2Table of ContentsRisk Factors SummaryThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, all of which are more fully described in the section titled “Risk Factors
” This summary should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Factors” section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business

The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and will continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition

We have incurred net losses in each year since inception, and we may not be able to achieve profitability
 We incurred net losses of $16
9 million, $674
3 million, and $4
6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively
 Our accumulated deficit was $6
0 billion as of December 31, 2020

Our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have been declining, and this trend could continue

Our revenue growth rate has slowed, and we expect it to continue to slow in the future

If we fail to retain existing hosts or add new hosts, or if hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected

If we fail to retain existing guests or add new guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected

Any further and continued decline or disruption in the travel and hospitality industries or economic downturn would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition

The business and industry in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors

Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business may limit the ability or willingness of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition

We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition

Our substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition
We had outstanding indebtedness with a principal amount of $1,9950 million as of December 31, 2020
The multi-series structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain holders of our common stock,
including our directors,
executive officers,
and 5% stockholders
and their respective affiliates,
who beneficially owned in the aggregate 48
5% of our outstanding capital stock
but hold in the aggregate 59
6% of the voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2020
This ownership will limit or preclude other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters,
including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents,
and any merger,
consolidation,
sale of all or substantially all of our assets,
or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities
In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2013 tax year proposing an increase to our US taxable income
that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $135 billion,
plus penalties and interest,
which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $10 billion
Business Overview
Airbnb is a community based on connection
and belonging — a community
that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home,
and has since grown to 4 million hosts
who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals to approximately 100,000 cities in almost every country
and region across the globe
Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people
who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection
and being at home
Airbnb has five stakeholders
and is designed with all of them in mind
Along with employees
and share holders,
we serve hosts,
guests,
and the communities in which they live
We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders
because their collective success is key for our business to thrive
Hosting is at the Center Airbnb’s hosts are the foundation of our community and business
Stays are made possible by hosts
It is their individuality that makes Airbnb unique
From schoolteachers to artists, our hosts span more than 220 countries
and regions and approximately 100,000 cities
As of December 31, 2020, we had 4 million hosts around the world,
with 86% of hosts located outside of the United States
Airbnb enables hosts to provide guests access to a vast world of unique homes
and experiences that were previously inaccessible, or even undiscovered
The role of the host is about more than opening their door
A great host enables guests to find a deeper connection to the places they visit
and the people who live there
Our community of hosts started by sharing their spare bedrooms on Airbnb in a few large cities
Soon, hosts listed entire homes, cabins, treehouses, boats, castles,
and luxury villas — practically any space
that you could think of — in big cities, small towns,
and rural communities in nearly every corner of the world
Our hosts generally fall into two categories: individual and professional
Individual hosts are those who activate their listings directly on Airbnb through our website or mobile apps
Individual hosts are the core of our host community
They come from all walks of life and list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes on Airbnb
Professional hosts are often those who run property management or hospitality businesses
and generally use application programming interfaces to list their properties on our platform
These hosts expand the types of listings available to our guests
Once there were millions of homes on Airbnb, we recognized that hosts could share not only their homes but also their interests and talents
From exploring graffiti art in New York City to finding hidden jazz clubs in London,
Airbnb Experiences offer authentic activities in over 1,000 cities around the world We believe
that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting provides
There are many more ways people will want to connect with each other
and the world around them, and so we will continue to design and enable new ways to host
No matter what form it takes, hosting will be at the center of Airbnb
Host Endowment Fund In October 2020, we established a Host Endowment Fund that is designed to allow hosts to share in the success of our business
The Host Endowment Fund was funded with 92 million shares of our Class H common stock
and is intended to be a long-term investment in the future of the host community, to be shaped by hosts for hosts
The goal of the Host Endowment Fund is to support
and benefit the host community through a variety of potential programs,
initiatives,
and grants
We want hosts to share in our success,
not merely for a single moment in time,
but for as long as Airbnb exists in the world
In December 2020, we introduced 17 hosts from 14 countries
and five continents as the first members of the Host Advisory Board for 2021
The Host Advisory Board is intended to give voices to hosts to help present ideas,
inform Airbnb policies,
and shape investments in the host community from the Host Endowment Fund
Guests are Members of Our Community Our hosts have welcomed hundreds of millions of guest arrivals through Airbnb
Guest arrivals represent an individual
and all co-travelers included on a reservation for a stay for completed check-ins during a given period
Our guests are not transactions —
they are engaged, contributing members of our community
From young people to retirees,
our guests come from a range of cultures and places
They seek everything from budget stays to luxury accommodations in large cities to remote villages
What they often have in common is a curiosity about the world
and open-mindedness to other people and cultures
While Airbnb is popular across people of all ages,
we are particularly strong with younger travelers:
as of December 31, 2020,
the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the ages of 18 and 34
Once they become a part of Airbnb, guests actively participate in our community, many return regularly to our platform to book again, and recommend Airbnb to others who then join themselves
This demand encourages new hosts to join,
which in turn attracts even more guests
It is a virtuous cycle — guests attract hosts,
and hosts attract guests
A Resilient Model In early 2020, as COVID-19 disrupted travel across the world,
Airbnb’s business declined significantly
But within two months,
our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel,
demonstrating its resilience
People wanted to get out of their homes
and yearned to travel,  (# 4 Table of Contents)
but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies
Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home
Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb
We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere
Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling
And just as when Airbnb started during the Great Recession of 2008,
we believe
that people will continue to turn to hosting to earn extra income
In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19
and the uncertainty it has produced around the world,
we do not believe it is possible to predict COVID-19’s cumulative
and ultimate impact on our future business,
results of operations,
and financial condition
COVID-19 has materially adversely affected our recent operating
and financial results and is continuing to materially adversely impact our long-term operating and financial results
However,
we believe
that as the world recovers from this pandemic,
Airbnb will be a vital source of economic empowerment for millions of people
For almost a year, many travelers have avoided traveling long distance because of COVID-19 concerns,
quarantines,
and travel restrictions
We expect the early part of 2021 will continue to be characterized by lower demand for long distance travel
and overall depressed bookings compared to 2019
While the outlook for the entire year is unclear,
we believe there may be opportunity for travel recovery as the rate of vaccinations increases
and quarantine requirements
and travel restrictions are lifted
According to a survey conducted by us in December 2020, 54% of the respondents said
they have either already booked,
are currently planning on traveling,
or expect to travel in 2021
This includes 57% of 18- to 29-year-olds,
and 60% of 30- to 49-year-olds
We are preparing for when travel rebounds as there will be a collective desire for two things:
travel and human connection
Our Long-Term Growth Strategy Our strategy is to continue to invest in our key strengths:
Unlock more hosting
In order to have enough selection for guests booking on our platform,
we will continue to invest in growing the size
and quality of our host community
We plan to attract more hosts globally
and expand new use cases such as long-term stays
We will support emerging travel trends,
such as local travel and remote working,
and design new ways to host
Finally,
we will continue to increase the support we provide our hosts to deliver high-quality stays
and experiences for guests
We plan to design new tools and services
and to offer comprehensive host education,
partnering with hosts to teach the art
and science of great hosting
We believe
that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting can provide
Grow and engage our guest community
We intend to attract new guests to Airbnb and convert more of them into brand advocates
We will continue to focus on engaging our existing guests to return to book and to use Airbnb with more frequency
With new behaviors evolving during the COVID-19 pandemic, we imagine the way that people approach work, living, and travel will fundamentally change
We believe there will be opportunities to create products based on these new behaviors and attract more guests to our platform
Finally,
we plan to develop new ways for our guests to connect with each other
and to contribute back to Airbnb
Invest in our brand
We intend to invest more deeply in our brand to educate new hosts
and guests on the benefits of Airbnb
and the uniqueness of our offering
We also intend to leverage our brand by creating a cohesive
and integrated marketing strategy punctuated by product launches
that introduce new features to our community and prospective hosts
and guests
Expand our global network
We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence,
as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower,
such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia,
and tens of thousands of smaller markets
and remote areas around the world
We will make Airbnb more accessible in more places by further localizing our product,
and we will partner with communities to update laws
and regulations for short-term rentals to allow more hosts to participate
As we attract more hosts,
even more guests are likely to come to Airbnb,
attracting even more hosts
Innovate on our platform
We will innovate both the online and in-person experiences for our hosts
and our guests Our innovation will be focused on improving our host
and guest experience,
making Airbnb more accessible
and appealing for new hosts
and guests and driving increased engagement
and loyalty with our existing community
Design new products and offerings
We will design new opportunities for connection
As the world continues to change, we will continue to bring together new technologies with our design expertise to expand possibilities for our hosts
and offer new experiences for our guests
We will increase the capabilities of our website
and mobile apps while bringing an innovative approach to designing host
and guest interfaces in our products
Our Strategy for Adapting to COVID-19
Many of our hosts have been severely impacted by COVID-19,
with increased cancellations and a drop in bookings
Despite the impact of COVID-19 on host earnings
and our business, our host
and active listing counts were stable for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of users with available listings, defined as accommodations
and experiences
that are viewable on a certain date on our platform (excluding Hotel Tonight),
as of a certain date
and we consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an “active listing” if it is viewable on Airbnb
and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb (excluding Hotel Tonight)
In addition, many of our guests have been unable to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic
Despite this, starting in the second half of 2020, demand from guests grew year-over-year for stays less than 50 miles
and within 50-300 miles from guest origin and long-term stays,
or stays on our platform of at least 28 nights
We believe the way people travel will fundamentally change
Since the pandemic started,
we have seen guests turn to Airbnb for new use cases,
such as living closer to family,
living nomadically,
working remotely,
and remote schooling
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced
that travel is an enduring human desire,
even in the face of challenges
People have increasingly sought travel options closer to home during COVID-19,
and Airbnb’s offerings are well suited to adapt to this changing dynamic
We offer all types of accommodations,
allowing guests to find spaces suited to their individual needs under these circumstances
We have worked closely with our hosts,
guests,
and communities to prioritize
and support safe
and responsible travel during these challenging times
and have adapted our offerings for changing trends in travel and experiences
Specifically,
based on the increase in domestic and short-distance travel,
we updated our website and mobile apps to actively promote available local
and non-urban stays so guests can find something
that fits their unique needs for location
and desired length of time
In addition, in order to support hosts
and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic,
we applied our extenuating circumstances policy to a significant number of impacted reservations
This policy allows hosts
and guests to cancel reservations
that are disrupted by epidemics,
natural disasters,
and other emergencies
To support our hosts
and lessen the impact of cancellations under this policy,
we committed up to $250 million for hosts impacted by COVID-19
and an additional $17 million fund for Superhosts,
the majority of which was distributed as of December 31, 2020
The reservations eligible for the $250 million host program were defined as reservations made on or before March 14, 2020 with a check-in date between March 14, 2020
and May 31, 2020
Check-ins represent individual stays or experiences
that occur during a period that have not been canceled
For these reservations,
eligible hosts are entitled to receive 25% of the amount they would have received from guests under the host’s cancellation policies
Our Platform
Our Platform for Hosts Hosts have a variety of needs,
and we are focused on designing solutions to serve them
We built our platform to seamlessly onboard new hosts,
especially those who previously had not considered hosting
We partner with hosts throughout the process of setting up their listing
and provide them with a robust suite of tools to successfully manage their listings,
including scheduling, merchandising,
integrated payments,
community support,
host protections,
pricing recommendations,
and feedback from reviews
Our host protection program provides property damage protection of up to $1 million for every listing
and liability coverage to hosts of up to $1 million per occurrence in the event of third-party claims of personal injury
or property damage
We are constantly innovating our platform to deliver new tools
and services to make hosting easier and empower hosts to earn income doing what they love
Our Platform for Guests Airbnb’s website
and mobile apps provide our guests with an engaging way to explore a wide variety of unique homes
and experiences and an easy way to book them
Our homepage showcases inspiring,
browsable content that highlights the product’s range
and shows off the best of our inventory
The listing for each stay or experience tells potential guests everything they need to know through photos, reviews from past guests,
and detailed descriptions
At checkout, guests can review trip details
and pay all on one simplified screen
Everything a guest needs to know before, during, or after their trip is stored on one clear, easy-to-follow page
We enable customizable wishlists for guests in the planning stage of travel,
in-app guest-to-host messaging before, during, and after a trip,
and an easy way to leave reviews
that contribute back to the Airbnb community
Our System of Trust One of our core innovations has been the design of a system
that allows millions of strangers to trust one another
Hosts and guests have the ability to communicate before booking,
pay through our secure payments platform,
and post reviews after their stays or experiences
Our trust team works to help protect our community by deploying risk scoring,
fraud detection,
screening,
verification,
and other technologies
and processes
that vary depending on the region
Our trained safety agents are available should our hosts
and guests need to reach us
We offer additional support to our community through our Host Guarantee Program
which protects hosts against property damage of up to $1 million,
and our Host Protection Insurance and Experience Protection Insurance,
which provide liability insurance of up to $1 million to protect our hosts against qualifying third-party claims for personal injury or property damage
Through our trust innovations,
our goal is to help make Airbnb stays
and experiences safe for hosts, guests,
and communities
The system for trust
that we have designed includes the following components: reviews, secure messaging
and account protection, risk scoring, secure payments, watchlist
and background checks in certain jurisdictions, cleanliness, fraud
and scam prevention, insurance and protections, booking restrictions, an urgent safety line, 24/7 neighborhood support line,
and guest refund policy
In addition to these components,
we have new initiatives in the pipeline and will continue to create additional features to strengthen the trust
and safety on our platform
Designing for trust has been a core principle from the very beginning,
and as we innovate new ways for strangers to trust one another,
we make it possible for more connections to be made
Our Technology We built our technology platform to power our global network of hosts
and guests
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,480 engineers within our product development organization
Given the nature of the business, our technology platform has broad
and complex requirements:
Our core platform supports global payment capabilities,
multilingual real-time community safety
and support,
and city-specific product requirements,
and it contains sophisticated anti-fraud measures
It delivers deep business intelligence insights to manage our marketplace,
including pricing insights
and occupancy optimization for our hosts
It incorporates sophisticated machine learning to power key areas,
from fraud detection to enabling customized
and real-time community support
To allow us to respond even more rapidly
and efficiently to evolving consumer needs,
we are moving our platform from a legacy monolith to a service-oriented architecture
Our transition to a service-oriented architecture is only one part of a plan to make our core business capabilities available as granular services
that accelerate creation of new products and offerings
This work will continue as we build a platform
that is increasingly robust, agile,
and efficient
In parallel, we will continue to develop our foundational technology with a focus on the following broad capabilities:
Data management systems that continue to support user privacy, analytics, machine learning, and business insights
Service reliability leading to best-in-class performance centered on availability, latency,
disaster recovery and business continuity, security, testability, observability, operability,
and agility
Cloud support focusing on robust capabilities for granular attribution
and usage patterns to realize efficiency gains
We currently rely primarily on Amazon Web Services to provide cloud computing services
Our aim in making these investments is to continue to develop a robust platform
that allows us to more quickly adapt to the needs of our hosts
and guests around the world and increase the productivity of our product development organization
Our Marketing Our marketing strategy includes brand marketing, communications,
and performance marketing
Brand marketing increases awareness among potential hosts and guests,
helping them understand the benefits of hosting
and booking stays and experiences
and what makes these stays
and experiences distinctly Airbnb
Our communications team works across press, policy,
and influencers to share timely
and important news about Airbnb
They also oversee the execution of a global consumer, product, corporate,
and policy communications plan that supports our brand strategy
and generates considerable press and social media coverage
While performance marketing drives additional traffic from high-intent prospective guests,
the strength of the Airbnb brand
and our communications strategy allows us to be less reliant on performance marketing
Our Employees As of December 31, 2020, we had 5,597 employees in 27 cities around the world
Because of the COVID-19 crisis,
we made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 1,800 employees in May 2020,
which was approximately a quarter of our workforce at the time
As of December 31, 2020,
we relied on a network of approximately 7,570 third-party partners
that are spread across 24 sites,
and individuals who work from home around the world to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts
Our internal community support employees are comprised of operations teams
who handle complex
and sensitive issues and enablement teams who support all community-facing teams,
including our partners
We are proud of our approach to working with partners and our deep relationships with them
Our Culture The most defining part of working at Airbnb is our culture
Our culture is optimistic, with people who are passionate about our mission, caring about others, and curious about the world
We took the unique characteristics of the people at Airbnb and distilled them to four values:
Champion the mission
Our employees are deeply passionate about connection and belonging, and the product that we make to deliver this
In fact, many of our employees are people from our host and guest community whom we hired
Be a host
Our employees are the kind of people who like caring for others
and making them feel like they belong,
just like the hosts in our community
Embrace the adventure
Our employees are curious
and optimistic — you have to be an optimistic person to believe
that the idea of Airbnb is a good one,
and you have to be curious about other people
and cultures to want to connect with them
Be a cereal entrepreneur
Our employees are bold
and resourceful
We believe that every person who joins Airbnb, from board members
and executives to college new hires, should share these four attributes
Most importantly, we believe
that whatever we want to happen outside the walls of Airbnb should first start inside Airbnb
This starts with our own employees
In this way, our culture is the source of all future innovation,
and a North Star for how people in our community should treat each other
Diversity and Belonging At Airbnb, diversity
and belonging is more than a corporate responsibility — it is central to what we stand for
We attract a diverse group of people
and welcome their varied knowledge, experiences,
and backgrounds
Through our hiring process, we commit to encouraging diversity
and eliminating bias,
and we publish the changing demographic makeup of our workforce to hold ourselves accountable
As of December 31, 2020, under-represented minority populations represented 12% of our US-based employees
and those who identify in the gender binary as women made up 47% of our global employees
We have set a goal for ourselves by the end of 2025 to have 20% of our product development
and information technology employees be under-represented minorities at all levels, 20% of our US
employees be under-represented minorities,
and 50% of employees at all levels be women, using the gender binary
Also, we announced a commitment
that 20% of our Board of Directors and Executive Team,
collectively, will be people of color by the end of 2021
Reducing the Incidents of Bias on Airbnb
Airbnb is centered around belonging,
and discrimination is a central obstacle to it
Just as discrimination exists in society,
it exists in the Airbnb community,
and we are committed to combating it
In 2016, we began taking steps to address discrimination on Airbnb
First, we created the Airbnb Nondiscrimination Policy,
which we required every host
and guest to agree to in order to use Airbnb
If a host or guest does not agree to the policy,
they are removed from our platform
Next, we created an anti-discrimination team of technical professionals that work to fight bias
and discrimination, changed the way we show profile photos so hosts only see a guest’s photo after a reservation is confirmed,
and distributed an antiracism guide to our hosts
and guests in the United States
Most recently, in June 2020, we launched Project Lighthouse, a groundbreaking project launched in partnership with Color of Change, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization, along with guidance from civil rights groups and privacy rights organizations
Project Lighthouse will allow us to measure discrimination on Airbnb based on perception
These perceptions will be aggregated and used to identify and measure discrepancies in people’s experiences that could be the result of discrimination
We will use the findings from Project Lighthouse to inform and design our products and policies to combat racial discrimination that Black guests and other people of color face when using Airbnb
Regulations
We are subject to laws, regulations,
and rules that affect the short-term rental
and home sharing business at city, state
and country levels
While a number of cities
and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals,
there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws,
and could follow suit and enact regulations
New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the approximately 100,000 cities where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties
In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our hosts and guests could be negatively impacted
We seek to work with governments to establish clear, fair,
and workable home sharing rules to create clarity for our hosts
No single city represented more than 1
1% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives
and refunds during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 12% of our active listings as of December 31, 2020
Incentives include our referral programs
and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform
and attract new customers, while our refunds to customers are part of our customer support activities
We do not believe that the current regulations in our top 10 cities, in the aggregate, have had or are expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations
and financial condition
We will continue to collaborate with policymakers to implement sensible legislation around the world
In addition to laws, regulations,
and rules directly applicable to the short-term rental
and home sharing business, we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations
and rules governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce,
and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, Internet access, competition,
and unfair commercial practices
We are also subject to laws, regulations,
and rules governing the provision of online payment services, the design and operation of our platform,
and the operations, characteristics,
and quality of our platform and services
Our payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations,
and regulatory guidance, including those governing: cross-border
and domestic money transmission and funds transfers
stored value and prepaid access
foreign exchange
privacy, data protection,
and cybersecurity
banking secrecy
payment services
(including payment processing
and settlement services)
consumer protection
economic and trade sanctions
anti-corruption and anti-bribery
and anti-money laundering
and counter-terrorist financing
We are subject to a variety of taxes
and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state,
and local)
and numerous foreign jurisdictions
We have received communications from numerous foreign, federal, state,
and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our hosts
and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions against our hosts and guests
In many jurisdictions where applicable, we have agreed to collect
and remit various taxes on behalf of our hosts
We have been subject to complaints by,
and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by,
certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct or indirect taxes
In some jurisdictions we are in disputes with respect to past and future taxes
A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various types of taxes to businesses like ours
Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform,
and to our hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions,
and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws
and regulations will be applied
As we continue to expand the reach of our brand into additional markets,
we will be increasingly subject to additional laws, regulations, and rules
These laws, regulations, and rules are complex and constantly evolving
and can be subject to significant change
Some of these laws, regulations,
and rules are inconsistent
and ambiguous and are being tested in courts,
and could be interpreted by regulators
and courts in ways
that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
and financial condition
Moreover, certain laws, regulations,
and rules have not historically been applied in the context of the short-term rental
and home sharing business, so the application
and interpretation of these requirements are often uncertain
For additional information regarding these
and other laws, regulations,
and rules that affect us and our business, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies –
Legal
and Regulatory Matters – Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A
Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year
In a typical year, the first, second,
and third quarters have higher Nights
and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter,
as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season,
which is in the third quarter for North America and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”)
Nights and Experiences
Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays
and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations
that occurred in that period
Our business metrics including Gross Booking Value (“GBV”)
and Adjusted EBITDA can also be impacted by the timing of holidays
and other events
GBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period
and is inclusive of host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees,
and taxes, net of cancellations
and alterations that occurred during that period
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss adjusted for (i) provision for (benefit from) income taxes
(ii) interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net
(iii) depreciation and amortization
(iv) stock-based compensation expense
and stock-settlement obligations related to the initial public offering (“IPO”)
(v) acquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements
(vi) net changes to the reserves for lodging taxes for which management believes it is probable
that we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes
and (vii) restructuring charges
We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights
and Experiences Booked
Revenue, which consists of service fees, net of incentives
and refunds, charged to our customers,
and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been,
and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue
Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter
Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions,
and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first
and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins
As a result, increases in unearned fees make our Free Cash Flow
and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year
We typically see a slight decline in GBV
and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter,
which results in a decrease in unearned fees
and lower sequential level of Free Cash Flow,
and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter,
where Free CashFlow is typically negative
Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property
and equipment
As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme
In 2020, we have seen COVID-19 overwhelm the historical patterns of seasonality in our GBV, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA,
and Free Cash Flow as a result of travel restrictions
and changing travel preferences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic
We expect this impact on seasonality to continue as long as COVID-19 is impacting travel patterns globally
Data Protection and Privacy Our business uses, collects,
and processes the personal data of individuals in more than 220 countries and regions
As a result, compliance with laws on data protection
and privacy regulating the storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure,
and protection of personal data is core to our strategy
and integral to the creation of trust in our platform
We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures
and other procedures and protocols to protect data,
including data pertaining to hosts, guests, employees,
and other users
Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate
or prevent unauthorized access to such data
Regulators around the world continue to propose more stringent data protection
and privacy laws,
and these laws are rapidly increasing in number, complexity, enforcement, fines,
and penalties
For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018
and has resulted
nd will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens
and costs for companies with users
and operations in the European Union
and European Economic Area
The GDPR regulates a broad array of personal data
that can directly or indirectly identify an individual
and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties for noncompliance
Many large geographies,
which are important to our success,
including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable data privacy legislation or regulations
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce continue to call for greater regulation of the collection of personal data, as well as restrictions for certain targeted advertising practices
Numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws
and regulations governing the collection, use,
and processing of state residents’ personal data
For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) went into effect in California on January 1, 2020
The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours
and requires us to modify our data processing practices
and policies
and incur compliance related costs
and expenses
In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights
and Enforcement Act of 2020,
which further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements
and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements
These and other data protection and privacy laws
and their interpretations continue to develop
and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction
Non-compliance with these
and other laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability
Although we take steps to comply with applicable laws
and regulations, we cannot assure
that we will not be subject to regulatory or private action, including fines for non-compliance of data protection
and privacy laws, including in the event of an incident
We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret
or implement their legislation
or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations,
or financial condition
Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment
As we seek to expand our community globally, we face competition in attracting hosts
and guests
Competition for Hosts We compete to attract
and retain hosts to
and on our platform to list their homes and experiences,
as hosts have a range of options for doing so
We compete for hosts based on many factors including the volume of bookings generated by our guests, ease of use of our platform, the service fees we charge, host protections, such as our Host Protection Insurance,
and our brand
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on our cancellation and extenuating circumstances policies
that applied as the virus spread across the world
We believe
that hosts can earn more per night on Airbnb than other travel platforms due to our guest demand, our host tools
that empower hosts to be successful,
and our community built on trust and human interaction
Competition for Guests We compete to attract
and retain guests to and on our platform, as guests have a range of options to find
and book accommodations and experiences
We compete for guests based on many factors, including unique inventory
and availability of listings, the value and all-in cost of our offerings relative to other options, our brand, ease of use of our platform, the trust
and safety of our platform, and community support
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on the availability of inventory close to
where guests live
and in non-urban markets, as well as the perceived safety
and cleanliness of listings on our platform
Our competitors include:
Online travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Booking Holdings (including the brands Booking
com, KAYAK, Priceline
com,
and Agoda com)

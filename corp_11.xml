		<segment id="1" parent="2" relname="circumstance">On a square foot basis, it's probably 9%.</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="21" relname="circumstance">Rich Anderson Okay.</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="21" relname="circumstance">So let's say 9%, 10%.</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="circumstance">Is that your comfort zone to maintain it there.</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="6" relname="antithesis">The reason why I ask is you complete developments and put them into the operating portfolio and they start growing for you in producing cash NOI.</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="22" relname="span">I think that's a more valuable part of the story from the standpoint of the stock market.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="22" relname="preparation">I know you guys are development engine, and it's vital to continue that going.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="7" relname="circumstance">But from -- just from the standpoint of how your stock performs, I think the same-store portfolio and the production of cash rents is more valued by the market.</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="8" relname="condition">And so do you see development staying there or declining as the operating portfolio gets bigger?</segment>
		<segment id="10" >That would be my first question.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="12" relname="circumstance">Steve Budorick As a percentage, I would say, it would probably diminish a bit.</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="23" relname="span">Remember, we're a low-risk developer with a strong preference to build to a significant pre-lease or a build-to-suit.</segment>
		<segment id="13" >So we're not going to introduce more product than we see demand in our markets to maintain a targeted square footage ratio.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="result">But we've delivered, on average, over 1.1 million square feet of development leasing for a decade.</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="14" relname="circumstance">We have no reason on average over a longer period of time and think that would materially change.</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="evaluation">Rich Anderson I think you should never change your stripes as a developer, but I do think the stock market has the immediate gratification mentality when it comes to development.</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="16" relname="concession">That's just my opinion.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="19" relname="circumstance">So balancing that with what you need to do long term is, I guess, the essence of my question.</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="elaboration">The second question is the spread -- 200-basis-point spread between the leased percentage and the occupied percentage, 94 versus 92.</segment>
		<segment id="20" >I'm wondering how that might change in the future.</segment>

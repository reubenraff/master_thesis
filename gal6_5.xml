		<segment id="1" >And while yes, there are always some components that come from different parts of the world,</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="1" relname="circumstance">that has been actually a good competitive advantage for us and it remains so.</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="4" relname="elaboration">So that's encouraging us all. Sorry, Chris.</segment>
		<segment id="4" >On the question on the guidance,</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="4" relname="condition">what I would say is that certainly,</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="5" relname="result">we're excited about the Q1 results coming in better than we expected.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="8" relname="concession">There was a portion of that, that is related to customer order timing being earlier in the season that we think is not necessarily incremental for the year.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="23" relname="span">There is a portion of the Q1 results that was ahead of our expectation,</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="23" relname="evaluation">and that would be incremental for the year.</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="11" relname="background">On the other hand,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="24" relname="span">we've had incremental inflation that we've built into the outlook for the year of $80 million,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="24" relname="restatement">as we mentioned.</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="14" relname="motivation">And so there's a number of moving parts.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="25" relname="span">We think that the Q1 results give us confidence to maintain the outlook for the year despite the incremental inflation</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="25" relname="preparation">that we're going to incur, which largely is coming in Q2, 3 and 4.</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="17" relname="evaluation">So we feel good about the outlook,</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="26" relname="span">and that's how I would describe sort of where we are from a guidance perspective.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="26" relname="circumstance">The other point I would note is Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter.</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="circumstance">And so, although we started off better than we expected,</segment>
		<segment id="20" >we're just heading into the big seasonal periods here over the next 3 to 6 months.</segment>

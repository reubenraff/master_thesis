		<segment id="1" parent="2" relname="evidence">The screening of hundreds of thousands of molecules were -- actually to be accurate,</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="21" relname="span">we tested 600 after hundreds of thousands of iterations,</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="21" relname="circumstance">600 different molecules in four months. That would not be possible if it wasn't in silico.</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="5" relname="motivation">And then we selected the ones that we felt were binding the best.</segment>

		<segment id="7" parent="8" relname="preparation">Unidentified Analyst Obviously, this is a dramatic improvement.</segment>

		<segment id="10" parent="11" relname="preparation">What are you going to do now, now that you've done PAXLOVID versus the past?</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="24" relname="circumstance">And then if you could take the same argument and just expand it to the broader portfolio.</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="24" relname="elaboration">Albert Bourla I think not only antiviral or antifungal, but every molecule.</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="14" relname="background">That's the idea. We used for PAXLOVID very favorable regulatory environment that would allow us to speed up things, et cetera.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="25" relname="motivation">We used the fact that was characterized within Pfizer as the Lightspeed program which meant no resources are the question,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="25" relname="elaboration">because it was about COVID but clearly equal results I hope we will be able to develop for other molecules,</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="17" relname="motivation">so to move from clinical not only for antifungal or anti-infective, but for cardiovascular [indiscernible].</segment>

		<segment id="18" parent="26" relname="circumstance">or is there like another example of a program which you have now applied machine learning to successfully?</segment>
		<segment id="19" >Albert Bourla If there is another one -- Unidentified Analyst</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="18" relname="elaboration">Yes. So essentially, you did this huge program with PAXLOVID.</segment>

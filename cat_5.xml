		<segment id="1" parent="2" relname="evaluation">And in China, that market for Caterpillar is primarily hydraulic excavators,</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="3" relname="preparation">10-ton and above and we've told our investors</segment>
		<segment id="3" >that we believe that the market this year will be slightly less than it was in 2019.</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="5" relname="evaluation">So again but we've known that for a while.</segment>
		<segment id="5" >That's not that new. But in the other markets that we serve, demand continues to be quite strong and we have not seen a slowdown in demand.</segment>
		<segment id="6" >Chad Dillard Okay.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="8" relname="condition">And so let's just hypothesize here.</segment>
		<segment id="8" >So if we do go into a recession, are there any structural changes that you've made in your business that would --</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="8" relname="circumstance">that you potentially call out that could actually make a cyclical amplitude lesser or even like the trough earnings level higher?</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="preparation">Jim Umpleby So we introduced some Investor Day targets back in 2017 and then we upped the ante in 2019.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="10" relname="concession">And we know, again, we can't control the market but what we have said in our 2017</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="result">-- excuse me, 2019 Investor Day is that we would achieve adjusted operating profit margins 300 to 600 basis points above what we did in</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="12" relname="justify">-- between 2010 and 2016 at similar levels of sales.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="15" relname="condition">And quite frankly, there was a bit of skepticism when we rolled those out,</segment>
		<segment id="15" >people said,</segment>
		<segment id="16" >okay, well, you've demonstrated it on the way up but can you really do it on the way down in 2020?</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="16" relname="result">Unfortunately, we had a COVID-induced downturn where our top line fell 20% in one year.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="17" relname="result">Despite that 20% decline in sales, we still met our operating margin target.</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="justify">So, we -- I believe we have structurally changed our company.</segment>
		<segment id="20" >And over the last five years, since we introduced our new strategy,</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="20" relname="result">we have met our Investor Day targets for improved adjusted operating profit margin every year</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="elaboration">-- including a year when we had a 20% downturn.</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="22" relname="evidence">So we do believe we have the ability to perform better during the downturn.</segment>
		<segment id="24" >Chad Dillard Okay.</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="26" relname="evidence">So at the Analyst Day a few weeks ago, you gave a guidance that implied incremental margins like the 30% to 40% range.</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="27" relname="elaboration">Do you think you're going to be able to capture enough pricing this year to get you back to</segment>
		<segment id="27" >-- back on track to hitting your targets as we go into 2023?</segment>
		<segment id="28" >Jim Umpleby</segment>
		<segment id="29" >And the way we look at this is,</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="31" relname="condition">we really don't talk about incremental margins quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="32" relname="condition">Again, what we talk about is those adjusted operating profit margin targets,</segment>
		<segment id="32" >300 to 600 basis points based on that reference period of 2010 to 2016.</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="34" relname="condition">So what we believe we will meet those targets this year and we fully intend to meet them moving forward.</segment>
		<segment id="34" >Having said that, we also, again, we see that our total addressable market is increasing.</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="36" relname="preparation">We know we have to make increased investments in some products but we believe,</segment>
		<segment id="36" >based on everything we see, again our intent is to invest more.</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="36" relname="condition">Our total addressable market is increasing, we'll maintain our margins,</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="39" relname="purpose">meet those margin targets which should</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="40" relname="elaboration">-- which will increase --</segment>
		<segment id="40" >should increase our free cash flow [indiscernible] to the top line.</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="42" relname="circumstance">Chad Dillard So during the Analyst Day, you talked a lot about how CAT will operate in the energy transition.</segment>
		<segment id="42" >And so my question is more about what is the correct revenue growth algorithm?</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="42" relname="antithesis">Because if you look back to the early 2000s to like the 2010s,</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="43" relname="condition">Caterpillar grew at a kind of like high single-digit levels.</segment>

[CLS] basis for opinion [SEP]

[CLS] financial statements based on our audit ##s . we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board ( united states ) ( pc ##ao ##b ) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u . s . federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pc ##ao ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] we conducted our audit ##s of these consolidated [SEP]
[CLS] financial statements in accordance with the standards of the pc ##ao ##b . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated [SEP]
[CLS] financial statements are free of material miss ##tate ##ment , whether due to error or fraud . [SEP]
[CLS] our audit ##s included performing procedures to assess the risks of material miss ##tate ##ment of the consolidated [SEP]
[CLS] financial statements , whether due to error or fraud , and performing procedures that respond to those risks . such procedures included examining , on a test basis , evidence regarding the amounts and disclosure ##s in the consolidated [SEP]

[CLS] critical audit matters [SEP]
[CLS] the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that ( i ) relates to accounts or disclosure ##s that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ( ii ) involved our especially challenging , subjective , or complex judgments . the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated [SEP]
[CLS] financial statements , taken as a whole , and we are not , by communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure ##s to which it relates . [SEP]
[CLS] uncertain tax positions [SEP]
[CLS] as described in notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements , the company has recorded gross un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed tax benefits of $ 50 ##7 . 9 million relating to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 , 2020 . management evaluate ##s and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two - step approach . recognition , step one , occurs when management concludes that a tax position , based solely on its technical merits , is more - likely - than - not to be sustained upon examination . measurement , step two , determines the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxi ##ng authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information . the company is in various stages of examination in connection with its ongoing tax audit ##s globally and management believes that an adequate provision has been recorded for any adjustments that may result from tax audit ##s . however , the outcome of tax audit ##s cannot be predicted with certainty . if any issues addressed in the company ’ s tax audit ##s are resolved in a manner not consistent with management ’ s expectations , management may be required to record an adjustment to the provision for ( benefit from ) income taxes in the period such resolution occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are ( i ) the significant judgment by management when determining uncertain tax positions , including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the technical merits and the measurement of the tax positions based on interpretations of tax laws and legal ruling ##s ; ( ii ) a high degree of auditor judgment , subject ##ivity , and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management ’ s recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions ; and ( iii ) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge . [SEP]
[CLS] addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements . these procedures included , among others , ( i ) testing the complete ##ness of management ’ s assessment of the identification of uncertain tax positions ; ( ii ) testing the recognition and measurement of the liability for uncertain tax positions , including management ’ s assessment of the technical merits of the tax positions and the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained ; ( iii ) testing the information used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions , including inter ##com ##pan ##y agreements , international , federal , and state filing positions , and the related final tax returns ; ( iv ) evaluating the status and results of income tax audit ##s with the relevant tax [SEP]

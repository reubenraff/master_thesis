[CLS] seasonal ##ity [SEP]
[CLS] our business is seasonal , reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year . in a typical year , the first , second , and third quarters have higher nights and experiences booked than the fourth quarter , as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season , which is in the third quarter for north america and europe , the middle east , and africa ( “ em ##ea ” ) . nights and experiences booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences , net of cancellation ##s and alterations that occurred in that period . [SEP]
[CLS] our business metric ##s including gross booking value ( “ gb ##v ” ) and adjusted e ##bit ##da can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events . gb ##v represents the dollar value of booking ##s on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host earnings , service fees , cleaning fees , and taxes , net of cancellation ##s and alterations that occurred during that period . adjusted e ##bit ##da is defined as net income or loss adjusted for ( i ) provision for ( benefit from ) income taxes ; ( ii ) interest income , interest expense , and other income ( expense ) , net ; ( iii ) de ##pre ##ciation and amor ##ti ##zation ; ( iv ) stock - based compensation expense and stock - settlement obligations related to the initial public offering ( “ ip ##o ” ) ; ( v ) acquisition - related impacts consisting of gains ( losses ) recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements ; ( vi ) net changes to the reserves for lodging taxes for which management believes it is probable that we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and re ##mit ##ting such taxes ; and ( vii ) restructuring charges . [SEP]
[CLS] we experience seasonal ##ity in our gb ##v that is generally consistent with the seasonal ##ity of nights and experiences booked . revenue , which consists of service fees , net of incentives and ref ##unds , charged to our customers , and adjusted e ##bit ##da have historically been , and are expected to continue to be , highest in the third quarter when we have the most check - ins , which is the point at which we recognize revenue . seasonal trends in our gb ##v impact free cash flow for any given quarter . our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions , and we historically achieve our highest gb ##v in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check - ins . as a result , increases in une ##ar ##ned fees make our free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year . we typically see a slight decline in gb ##v and a peak in check - ins in the third quarter , which results in a decrease in une ##ar ##ned fees and lower sequential level of free cash flow , and a greater decline in gb ##v in the fourth quarter , where free cash [SEP]
[CLS] flow is typically negative . free cash flow represents net cash provided by ( used in ) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment . as our business mature ##s , other seasonal trends may develop , or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2020 , we have seen co ##vid - 19 over ##w ##helm the historical patterns of seasonal ##ity in our gb ##v , revenue , adjusted e ##bit ##da , and free cash flow as a result of travel restrictions and changing travel preferences relating to the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . we expect this impact on seasonal ##ity to continue as long as co ##vid - 19 is impact ##ing travel patterns globally . [SEP]
[CLS] data protection and privacy [SEP]
[CLS] our business uses , collects , and processes the personal data of individuals in more than 220 countries and regions . as a result , compliance with laws on data protection and privacy regulating the storage , sharing , use , processing , transfer , disclosure , and protection of personal data is core to our strategy and integral to the creation of trust in our platform . we take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data , including data pertaining to hosts , guests , employees , and other users . despite measures we put in place , we may be unable to anti ##ci ##pate or prevent unauthorized access to such data . [SEP]
[CLS] regulators around the world continue to propose more string ##ent data protection and privacy laws , and these laws are rapidly increasing in number , complexity , enforcement , fines , and penalties . for example , the european general data protection regulation 2016 / 67 ##9 ( “ gdp ##r ” ) became effective on may 25 , 2018 and has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burden ##s and costs for companies with users and operations in the european union and european economic area . the gdp ##r regulates a broad array of personal data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual and impose ##s string ##ent data protection requirements with significant penalties for non ##com ##pl ##iance . many large geo ##graph ##ies , which are important to our success , including australia , brazil , canada , china , and india , have passed or are in the process of passing comparable data privacy legislation or regulations . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the federal trade commission and the department of commerce continue to call for greater regulation of the collection of personal data , as well as restrictions for certain targeted advertising practices . numerous states have enacted or are in the process of en ##act ##ing state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection , use , and processing of state residents ’ personal [SEP]

[CLS] data . for example , the california consumer privacy act ( “ cc ##pa ” ) went into effect in california on january 1 , 2020 . the cc ##pa establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours and requires us to modify our data processing practices and policies and inc ##ur compliance related costs and expenses . in november 2020 , california voters passed the california privacy rights and enforcement act of 2020 , which further expands the cc ##pa with additional data privacy compliance requirements and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements . [SEP]
[CLS] these and other data protection and privacy laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . non - compliance with these and other laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability . although we take steps to comply with applicable laws and regulations , we cannot assure that we will not be subject to regulatory or private action , including fines for non - compliance of data protection and privacy laws , including in the event of an incident . we could be adverse ##ly affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third - party service providers ’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third - party service providers ’ business , results of operations , or financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] competition [SEP]
[CLS] we operate in a highly competitive environment . as we seek to expand our community globally , we face competition in attracting hosts and guests . [SEP]
[CLS] competition for hosts [SEP]
[CLS] we compete to attract and retain hosts to and on our platform to list their homes and experiences , as hosts have a range of options for doing so . we compete for hosts based on many factors including the volume of booking ##s generated by our guests , ease of use of our platform , the service fees we charge , host protections , such as our host protection insurance , and our brand . throughout the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , we have also competed based on our cancellation and ex ##ten ##uating circumstances policies that applied as the virus spread across the world . we believe that hosts can earn more per night on air ##bn ##b than other travel platforms due to our guest demand , our host tools that em ##power hosts to be successful , and our community built on trust and human interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] competition for guests [SEP]
[CLS] we compete to attract and retain guests to and on our platform , as guests have a range of options to find and book accommodations and experiences . we compete for guests based on many factors , including unique inventory and availability of listings , the value and all - in cost of our offerings relative to other options , our brand , ease of use of our platform , the trust and safety of our platform , and community support . throughout the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , we have also competed based on the availability of inventory close to where guests live and in non - urban markets , as well as the perceived safety and clean ##liness of listings on our platform . [SEP]
[CLS] our competitors include : [SEP]

[CLS] item 1a . risk factors [SEP]
[CLS] our business , operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertain ##ties , including those described below , that could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , financial condition , and the trading price of our class a common stock . the following material factors , among others , could cause our actual results to differ material ##ly from historical results and those expressed in forward - looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filing ##s with the sec , press releases , communications with investors , and oral statements . [SEP]
[CLS] risks related to our business [SEP]
[CLS] the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and the impact of actions to mit ##igate the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic have material ##ly adverse ##ly impacted and will continue to material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 2020 , the world health organization declared the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 a pan ##de ##mic . in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus , governments have imposed various restrictions , including emergency declaration ##s at the federal , state , and local levels , school and business closing ##s , qu ##aran ##tine ##s , “ shelter at home ” orders , restrictions on travel , limitations on social or public gatherings , and other social di ##stan ##cing measures , which have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and operations and on travel behavior and demand . [SEP]
[CLS] the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , which has required and may continue to require cost reduction measures , has material ##ly adverse ##ly affected our near - term operating and financial results and will continue to material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our long - term operating and financial results . during the fourth quarter of 2020 , another wave of co ##vid - 19 infections emerged . as a result , countries imposed strict lock ##down ##s , in particular in europe . similar to the impact of the initial co ##vid - 19 wave in march 2020 , we are seeing a decrease in booking ##s in the most affected regions and saw a significantly greater year - over - year decline in nights and experiences booked and gb ##v in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third quarter of 2020 . in light of the evolving nature of co ##vid - 19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world , we do not believe it is possible to predict the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic ’ s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business , results of operations , and financial condition . the extent of the impact of the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments , including the duration and extent of the spread of co ##vid - 19 both globally and within the united states , the prevalence of local , national , and international travel restrictions , significantly reduced flight volume , the impact on capital and financial markets and on the u . s . and global economies , foreign cu ##rre ##ncies exchange , and governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business , all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted . moreover , even after shelter - in - place orders and travel advisor ##ies are lifted , demand for our offerings , particularly those related to cross - border travel , may remain depressed for a significant length of time , and we cannot predict if and when demand will return to pre - co ##vid - 19 levels . in addition , we cannot predict the impact the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has had and will have on our business partners and third - party vendors and service providers , and we may continue to be material ##ly adverse ##ly impacted as a result of the material adverse impact our business partners and third - party vendors suffer now and in the future . to the extent the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic continues to material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition , it may also have the effect of height ##ening many of the other risks described in these “ risk factors ” or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10 - k . any of the fore ##going [SEP]
[CLS] in response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and its impact on our business , in may 2020 , we announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately 1 , 800 employees . this reduction in workforce particularly impacted our marketing , design , customer service , transportation , air ##bn ##b studios , hotels , and air ##bn ##b lux ##e teams . this reduction in workforce also resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge , relationships , and expertise for critical roles , which may not have been effectively transferred to continuing employees and may divert attention from operating our business , create personnel capacity constraints , and ham ##per our ability to grow , develop innovative products , and compete . any of these impacts could material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business and reputation and imp ##ede our ability to operate or meet strategic objectives . this has led to increased at ##tri ##tion and could lead to reduced employee morale and productivity and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees , which could have a material adverse impact on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . the reduction in force and other restructuring activities resulted in a charge of $ 151 . 4 million in 2020 . [SEP]
[CLS] most of our employees and third - party vendors and service providers are working remotely , and it is possible that widespread remote work arrangements could have a material ##ly negative impact on host and guest satisfaction resulting from potential delays or slower than usual response times in receiving assistance from our customer support organization . the negative impact on our hosts ’ and guests ’ satisfaction could adverse ##ly impact our operations , the execution of our business plans , and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business , and of third - party service providers that perform critical services for us , or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and related governmental actions . if a natural disaster , power out ##age , connectivity issue , or other event occurs that impacts our employees ’ ability to work remotely , it may be difficult or , in certain cases , impossible , for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time . the increase in remote working may also result in material consumer privacy , information technology security , and fraud risks . the reduction in force in may 2020 and remote work arrangements resulting from the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic caused us to recognize an impairment of certain of our real property lease arrangements , and depending on the duration and extent of the remote work arrangements , we may inc ##ur additional impairment charges related to our real property lease agreements . the manner in which we have adjusted our business following the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic is based on our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements , as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities , and is subject to legal or regulatory challenge , particularly as regulatory guidance evolve ##s in response to future developments .

[CLS] we have incurred net losses in each year since inception , and we may not be able to achieve profit ##ability . [SEP]
[CLS] we incurred net losses of $ 16 . 9 million , $ 67 ##4 . 3 million , and $ 4 . 6 billion for the years ended december 31 , 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had an accumulated deficit of $ 6 . 0 billion . historically , we have invested significantly in efforts to grow our host and guest community , introduced new or enhanced offerings and features , increased our marketing spend , expanded our operations , hired additional employees , and enhanced our platform . beginning in the second quarter of 2020 , as a result of co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , we have significantly reduced our fixed and variable costs including a reduction in force and a suspension of substantially all discretion ##ary marketing program spend . however , overall , we expect to resume making significant investments in our business and our host and guest community , including improvements to our payments platform , trust and safety on our platform , technology , infrastructure , and investments in our brand . these efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anti ##ci ##pate , and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses . in particular , we expect the ongoing economic impact from the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic to continue to material ##ly and adverse ##ly impact our revenue and financial results for 2021 . while we have enacted measures to reduce our expenses , we expect to inc ##ur a significant net loss for 2021 primarily as a result of the continued impact of the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , stock - based compensation expense , and interest expense . [SEP]
[CLS] certain of our offerings and certain regions in which we operate result in listings with lower service fees and will require significant additional investments from us , which could have a material ##ly negative impact on our overall operating margins as these offerings and regions increase in size over time relative to other areas in which we operate . for example , seats for air ##bn ##b experiences are generally booked at lower prices than nights booked for stays . in addition , we have changed , and may in the future reduce , our service fees for strategic or competitive reasons . any failure to increase our revenue or any failure to manage the increase in our operating expenses could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profit ##ability as measured by net income , operating income , or adjusted e ##bit ##da . [SEP]
[CLS] we have granted restricted stock units ( “ rs ##us ” ) to our employees and certain non - employees , with substantially all of such rs ##us vest ##ing upon the satisfaction of both a service - based vest ##ing condition and a liquid ##ity - based vest ##ing condition . our financial statements as of december 31 , 2020 and for the year then - ended include stock - based compensation expense of $ 2 . 8 billion associated with the vest ##ing of rs ##us in connection with our initial public offering for which the re ##quisite service - based vest ##ing condition was met as of december 31 , 2020 . following our initial public offering in december 2020 , we began recording stock - based compensation expense for rs ##us where the liquid ##ity - based vest ##ing condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our registration statement for the initial public offering on december 9 , 2020 . stock - based compensation expense related to rs ##us and other equity awards will continue to be a significant expense in future periods . [SEP]
[CLS] our adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow have been declining , and this trend could continue . [SEP]
[CLS] we had adjusted e ##bit ##da of $ 170 . 6 million , $ ( 253 . 3 ) million , and $ ( 250 . 7 ) million for the years ended december 31 , 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 , respectively . our free cash flow was $ 50 ##4 . 9 million , $ 97 . 3 million , and $ ( 66 ##7 . 1 ) million for the years ended december 31 , 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 , respectively . our adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow declined in 2019 , as a result of our decision to make 2019 a year in which we made significant investments in new product and growth initiatives , including in china , and to improve our technical infrastructure . as a result of the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and the resulting impact on the travel industry , our adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow remained negative in 2020 , and we may experience declines in adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow as long as the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic continues to material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business . other adverse developments in our business , including lower than anticipated revenue , higher than anticipated operating expenses , and net un ##fa ##vor ##able changes in working capital , could hind ##er our ability to reverse the recent negative trend in our adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow . if our future adjusted e ##bit ##da or free cash flow fail to meet investor or analyst expectations , it is likely to have a material ##ly negative effect on our stock price . adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow are supplemental metric ##s that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaa ##p . see the section titled “ management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key business metric ##s and non - gaa ##p financial measures ” for a reconciliation of adjusted e ##bit ##da and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with gaa ##p and for additional information .

[CLS] our revenue growth rate has slowed , and we expect it to continue to slow in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] we have experienced significant revenue growth in the past ; however , our revenue growth has slowed in recent periods and there is no assurance that historic growth rates will return . our year - over - year growth rate in revenue decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 and also decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017 . for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , as a result of the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , our revenue decreased significantly compared to the year ended december 31 , 2019 . our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform , and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries . in addition , we believe that our revenue growth depends upon a number of factors , including : [SEP]

[CLS] a soft ##ening of demand , whether caused by events outside of our control , such as co ##vid - 19 , changes in host and guest preferences , any of the other factors described above , or in this annual report on form 10 - k or otherwise , will result in decreased revenue . if our revenue does not improve , we may not achieve profit ##ability and our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] if we fail to retain existing hosts or add new hosts , or if hosts fail to provide high - quality stays and experiences , our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] our business depends on hosts maintaining their listings on our platform and engaging in practices that encourage guests to book those listings , including increasing the number of nights and experiences that are available to book , providing timely responses to inquiries from guests , offering a variety of desirable and differentiated listings at competitive prices that meet the expectations of guests , and offering exceptional hospitality , services , and experiences to guests . these practices are outside of our direct control . if hosts do not establish or maintain a sufficient number of listings and availability for listings , the number of nights and experiences booked declines for a particular period , or the price charged by hosts declines , our revenue would decline and our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] hosts manage and control their spaces and experiences and typically market them on our platform with no obligation to make them available to guests for specified dates and with no obligation to accept booking ##s from prospective guests . we have had many hosts list their properties on our platform in one period and cease to offer these properties in subsequent periods for a variety of reasons . while we plan to continue to invest in our host community and in tools to assist hosts , these investments may not be successful in growing our hosts and listings on our platform . in addition , hosts may not establish or maintain listings if we cannot attract prospective guests to our platform and generate booking ##s from a large number of guests . if we are unable to retain existing hosts or add new hosts , or if hosts elect to market their listings exclusively with a competitor or cross - list with a competitor , we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of properties or experiences to attract guests to use our platform . in particular , it is critical that we continue to attract and retain individual hosts who list their spaces , including private rooms , primary homes , or vacation homes on air ##bn ##b . we attract individual hosts predominantly through organic channels such as word of mouth and our strong brand recognition . if we are unable to attract and retain individual hosts in a cost - effective manner , or at all , our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] professional hosts , including property management companies , serviced apartment providers , and boutique hotels , expand the types of listings available to our guests . these professional hosts often list on our platform as well as on the platforms of our competitors . we do not control whether professional hosts provide us with a sizable allocation of rooms and competitive pricing relative to the same properties listed with other services . if we are not able to effectively deploy professional tools , application programming interfaces , and payment processes , work with third - party channel managers , and develop effective sales and account management teams that address the needs of these professional hosts , we may not be able to attract and retain professional hosts . if our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our competitors , these professional hosts may choose to provide less inventory and availability with us . historically , we have seen an increase in the number of , and revenue from , professional hosts on our platform . the unique ##ness of listings on our platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual hosts does not grow at the same rate .

[CLS] in addition , the number of listings on air ##bn ##b has declined and may continue to decline as a result of a number of other factors affecting hosts , including : the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic ; enforcement or threatened enforcement of laws and regulations , including short - term o ##cc ##up ##ancy and tax laws ; private groups , such as home ##own ##ers , landlord ##s , and condom ##inium and neighborhood associations , adopting and enforcing contracts that prohibit or restrict home sharing ; leases , mortgage ##s and other agreements , or regulations that pu ##rp ##ort to ban or otherwise restrict home sharing ; hosts opt ##ing for long - term rental ##s on other third - party platforms as an alternative to listing on our platform ; economic , social , and political factors ; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our platform ; negative experiences with guests , including guests who damage host property , throw unauthorized parties , or engage in violent and unlawful acts ; and our decision to remove hosts from our platform for not ad ##hering to our host standards or other factors we dee ##m detrimental to our community . we believe a number of our hosts are individuals who rely on the additional income generated from our platform to pay their living expenses or mortgage ##s or have acquired properties specifically for listing . it is not yet clear what financial impact the severe travel reduction occurring during the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic will have on these individuals or whether they will be able to keep their homes or operate their businesses as travel resume ##s . our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected if our hosts are unable to return to normal operations in the near to immediate term . [SEP]
[CLS] we believe that our host protection programs are integral to retaining and acquiring hosts . our host protection insurance and experience protection insurance provide liability coverage to our hosts , with amounts paid to claim ##ants , for up to $ 1 million per occurrence in the event of a third - party claim of bodily injury or property damage related to a stay or experience , and our host guarantee program provides rei ##mb ##urse ##ment of up to $ 1 million for loss or damages to a host property caused by guests during a reservation . if we disco ##nti ##nu ##e these programs , whether because our pay ##outs under these programs or our insurance premium ##s become cost prohibit ##ive or for any other reason , then the number of hosts who list with us may decline . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to a reduction in the number of booking ##s , we have incurred , and expect to continue to inc ##ur , higher than normal payments via ref ##unds and travel credit iss ##uance to guests who cancel for reasons related to co ##vid - 19 . under our ex ##ten ##uating circumstances policy , guests who made reservations on or before march 14 , 2020 and cannot travel due to the pan ##de ##mic have been eligible to cancel their reservations for a full cash ref ##und or in some cases travel credit . similarly , hosts with reservations confirmed on or before march 14 , 2020 who cannot host due to the pan ##de ##mic have been eligible to cancel under this policy without adverse consequences . a large number of guest cancellation ##s under the policy caused lost earnings for our hosts . to support our hosts and less ##en the impact of cancellation ##s under [SEP]

[CLS] our ex ##ten ##uating circumstances policy , we have made a $ 250 million commitment , the majority of which has been distributed as of december 31 , 2020 , which provides hosts a portion of the amount they expected to earn from booking ##s that were canceled under this policy . the reservations eligible for this support program were defined as reservations made on or before march 14 , 2020 with a check - in date between march 14 , 2020 and may 31 , 2020 . for these reservations , eligible hosts are entitled to receive 25 % of the amount they would have received from guests under the host ’ s cancellation policies . because this commitment is limited in amount and time ##frame , hosts will not receive full payment related to guest cancellation ##s , and some hosts may remove their listings from our platform if they are not satisfied with our policies during the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . we have not seen a material change in the number of active listings on our platform between december 2019 and december 2020 . for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $ 205 . 1 million in payments to customers under this policy . [SEP]
[CLS] hosts and guests whose reservations are canceled under our ex ##ten ##uating circumstances policy have had and may continue to have a negative view of such policy and may experience negative financial impacts as a result of such cancellation ##s . this could material ##ly negatively impact our relationship with our hosts and guests , resulting in hosts leaving our platform , removing their listings and / or offering less availability , or fewer repeat guests , which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[SEP]
[CLS] any further and continued decline or disruption in the travel and hospitality industries or economic down ##turn would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our financial performance is dependent on the strength of the travel and hospitality industries . the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 has caused many governments to implement qu ##aran ##tine ##s and significant restrictions on travel or to advise that people remain at home where possible and avoid crowds , which has had a particularly negative impact on cross - border travel . in addition , most airlines have suspended or significantly reduced their flights during this period , further decreasing opportunities for travel . this has led to a decrease in our booking ##s and an increase in cancellation ##s and associated claims brought against us . we expect that co ##vid - 19 will continue to material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our booking ##s and business in 2021 and beyond . the extent and duration of such impact over the longer term remains uncertain and is dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time , such as the severity and transmission rate of co ##vid - 19 , the timing , availability , and effectiveness of a vaccine , the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken , including mobility restrictions , and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general , and on our business in particular . see our risk factor titled “ — the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and the impact of actions to mit ##igate the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic have material ##ly adverse ##ly impacted and will continue to material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business , results of operations , and financial condition . ” [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] our financial performance is also subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretion ##ary consumer spending . some of the factors that have an impact on discretion ##ary consumer spending include general economic conditions , worldwide or regional recession , unemployment , consumer debt , reductions in net worth , fluctuations in exchange rates , residential real estate and mortgage markets , taxation , energy prices , interest rates , consumer confidence , tariffs , and other macro ##economic factors . consumer preferences tend to shift to lower - cost alternatives during recession ##ary periods and other periods in which di ##sp ##osa ##ble income is adverse ##ly affected , which could lead to a decline in the booking ##s and prices for stays and experiences on our platform and an increase in cancellation ##s , and thus result in lower revenue . leisure travel in particular , which accounts for a substantial majority of our current business , is dependent on discretion ##ary consumer spending levels . down ##turn ##s in worldwide or regional economic conditions , such as the current down ##turn resulting from the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , have led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending , and similar down ##turn ##s in the future may material ##ly adverse ##ly impact demand for our platform and services . such a shift in consumer behavior would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] our competitors are adopting aspects of our business model , which could affect our ability to differentiate our offerings from competitors . increased competition could result in reduced demand for our platform from hosts and guests , slow our growth , and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us , such as greater name and brand recognition , longer operating histories , larger marketing budgets , and loyalty programs , as well as substantially greater financial , technical , and other resources . in addition , our current or potential competitors have access to larger user bases and / or inventory for accommodations , and may provide multiple travel products , including flights . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , our competitors may be able to provide consumers with a better or more complete product experience and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities , technologies , standards , or host and guest requirements or preferences . the global travel industry has experienced significant consolidation , and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry . consolidation amongst our competitors will give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity , abilities , and resources , and lower their cost structures . in addition , emerging start - ups may be able to inn ##ova ##te and focus on developing a new product or service faster than we can or may fore ##see consumer need for new offerings or technologies before us . [SEP]
[CLS] there are now numerous competing companies that offer homes for booking , which can be available on our platform , on competing platforms , and through direct booking sites . some of these competitors also aggregate property listings obtained through various sources , including the websites of property managers . some of our hosts have chosen to cross - list their properties , which reduces the availability of such properties on our platform . when properties are cross - listed , the price paid by guests on our platform may be or may appear to be less [SEP]

[CLS] competitive for a number of reasons , including differences in fee structure and policies , which may cause guests to book through other services , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . certain property managers reach out to our hosts and guests to inc ##ent ##iv ##ize them to list or book directly with them and bypass our platform , and certain hosts may encourage transactions outside of our platform , which reduces the use of our platform and services . [SEP]
[CLS] some of our competitors or potential competitors have more established or varied relationships with consumers than we do , and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position , including by entering the travel and accommodations businesses . for example , some competitors or potential competitors are creating “ super - apps ” where consumers can use many online services without leaving that company ’ s app , e . g . , in particular regions , such as asia , where e - commerce transactions are conducted primarily through apps on mobile devices . if any of these platforms are successful in offering services similar to ours to consumers , or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super - apps , our customer acquisition efforts could be less effective and our customer acquisition costs , including our brand and performance marketing expenses , could increase , any of which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . we also face increasing competition from search engines including google . how google presents travel search results , and its promotion of its own travel meta - search services , such as google travel and google vacation rental ads , or similar actions from other search engines , and their practices concerning search rankings , could decrease our search traffic , increase traffic acquisition costs , and / or di ##sin ##ter ##media ##te our platform . these parties can also offer their own comprehensive travel planning and booking tools , or refer leads directly to suppliers , other favored partners , or themselves , which could also di ##sin ##ter ##media ##te our platform . in addition , if google or apple use their own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own or other preferred travel service offerings , or impose policies that effectively di ##sal ##low us to continue our full product offerings in those channels , it could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our ability to engage with hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search . [SEP]
[CLS] laws , regulations , and rules that affect the short - term rental and home sharing business have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant penalties , which have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] since we began our operations in 2008 , there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short - term rental and home sharing business . hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for strict ##er regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions . other private groups , such as home ##own ##ers , landlord ##s , and condom ##inium and neighborhood associations , have adopted contracts or regulations that pu ##rp ##ort to ban or otherwise restrict short - term rental ##s , and third - party lease agreements between landlord ##s and tenants , home insurance policies , and mortgage ##s may prevent or restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces . in europe , a group of mayors representing 22 cities ( including amsterdam , barcelona , and london ) has been meeting with the european commission to seek increased regulatory control in relation to short - term rental platforms . these groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over - tourism in major cities , and some state and local governments have implemented or considered implementing rules , ordinance ##s , or regulations governing the short - term rental of properties and / or home sharing . such regulations include ordinance ##s that restrict or ban hosts from short - term rental ##s , set annual caps on the number of days hosts can share their homes , require hosts to register with the municipality or city , or require hosts to obtain permission before offering short - term rental ##s . in addition , some jurisdictions regard short - term rental or home sharing as “ hotel use ” and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property requiring a permitting process . macro ##economic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations , or interpretations of existing laws and regulations , that limit the ability of hosts to share their spaces . if laws , regulations , rules , or agreements significantly restrict or discourage hosts in certain jurisdictions from sharing their properties , it would have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] while a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short - term rental ##s , there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short - term rental laws , and could follow suit and en ##act regulations . new laws , regulations , government policies , or changes in their interpretations in the approximately 100 , 000 cities where we operate en ##tail significant challenges and uncertain ##ties . in the event of any such changes , pre - existing booking ##s may not be honored and current and future listings and booking ##s could decline significantly , and our relationship with our hosts and guests could be negatively impacted , which would have a material ##ly adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . for example , if new city regulations requiring us to share host data with such city are implemented , our revenue from listings there may be substantially reduced due to the departure from our platform of hosts who do not wish to share their data with the city . a reduction in supply and cancellation ##s could make our platform less attractive to guests , and any reduction in the number of guests could further reduce the number of hosts on our platform . [SEP]
[CLS] while we seek to work with governments , we have in the past , and are likely in the future to , become involved in disputes with government agencies regarding such laws and regulations . for example , some governments have attempted to impose fines on us regarding what they contend is illegal offering of short - term accommodations in violation of applicable laws . certain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose various types of taxes , including lodging taxes , often known as transient or o ##cc ##up ##ancy taxes , on our guests , collection and re ##mit ##tance obligations on our hosts and / or us , and with ##holding obligations on us , as more fully described in our risk factor titled “ — uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts , guests , or platform could increase our tax lia ##bilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform . ” in addition , some third parties and regulators have asserted that we , through our operations , are subject to regulations with respect to short - term rental ##s , host registration , licensing , and other requirements for the listing of accommodations and experiences , such as real estate broker or agent licenses , travel agency licenses , and insurance - related licenses . we could be held liable and inc ##ur significant financial and potential criminal penalties if we are found to have violated any of these regulations . in certain jurisdictions , we have resolved disputes concerning the application of these laws and regulations by agreeing , among other things , to share certain data with government agencies to assist in the enforcement of limits on short - term rental ##s as well as the enforcement of safety regulations , and to implement measures to confirm to the government that hosts are operating in compliance with applicable law . when a government agency seeks to apply laws and regulations in a manner that limits or curt ##ail ##s hosts ’ or guests ’ ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations in that particular geography , we have attempted and may continue to attempt through litigation or other means to defend against such application of laws and regulations , but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts . further , if we or our hosts and guests were required to comply with laws and regulations , government requests , or [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to a wide variety of complex , evolving , and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adverse ##ly impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform , and that could cause us to inc ##ur significant lia ##bilities including fines and criminal penalties , which could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] hosts list , and guests search for , stays and experiences on our platform in more than 220 countries and regions , and in approximately 100 , 000 cities throughout the world . there are national , state , local , and foreign laws and regulations in jurisdictions that relate to or affect our business . moreover , the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate are distinct and may result in inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations among local , regional , or national laws or regulations applicable to our business . compliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing varying standards and requirements is burden ##some for businesses like ours , impose ##s added cost and increases potential liability to our business , and makes it difficult to realize business e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies and economies of scale . for example , we inc ##ur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have di ##spar ##ate requirements around tax collection , tax reporting , host registration , limits on lengths of stays , and other regulations , each of which require us to de ##dicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have . the complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of di ##spar ##ate requirements can lead to compliance gaps if our internal resources cannot keep up with the pace of regulatory change and new requirements imposed on our platform , or if our platform does not work as intended or has errors or bugs . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be difficult or impossible for us to investigate or evaluate laws or regulations in all cities , countries , and regions . the application of existing laws and regulations to our business and platform can be unclear and may be difficult for hosts , guests , and us to understand and apply , and are subject to change , as governments or government agencies seek to apply legacy systems of laws or adopt new laws to new online business models in the travel and accommodations industries , including ours . uncertain and unclear application of such laws and regulations to host and guest activity and our platform could cause and has caused some hosts and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform , reduce supply and demand for our platform and services , increase the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations , and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to our platform , all of which would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . see also our risk factor titled “ — we could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform . ” [SEP]
[CLS] there are laws that apply to us , and there are laws that apply to our hosts and / or guests . while we require our hosts and guests to comply with their own independent legal obligations under our terms of service , we have limited means of enforcing or ensuring the compliance of our hosts and guests with all applicable legal requirements . sometimes governments try to hold us responsible for laws that apply to our hosts and / or guests . whether applicable to us , our hosts , and / or our guests , the related consequences arising out of such laws and regulations , including penalties for violations of and costs to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations , have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we take certain measures to comply , and to help hosts comply , with laws and regulations , such as requiring registration numbers to be displayed on a listing profile for listings in some jurisdictions where such registration is required . these measures , changes to them , and any future measures we adopt could increase friction on our platform , and reduce the number of listings available on our platform from hosts and booking ##s by guests , and could reduce the activity of hosts and guests on our platform . we may be subject to additional laws and regulations which could require significant changes to our platform that discourage hosts and guests from using our platform . our newer offerings , such as air ##bn ##b experiences , are subject to similar or other laws , regulations , and regulatory actions . in particular , if we become more involved in hosts ’ listings and conduct related to booking ##s , then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and under ##cut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us , which further con ##stra ##in our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform .

[CLS] we have been involved in litigation with national governments , trade associations and industry bodies , municipalities , and other government authorities , including as a plaintiff and as a defendant , concerning laws seeking to limit or outlaw short - term rental ##s and to impose obligations or liability on us as a platform . in the united states , we have been involved in various lawsuits concerning whether our platform is responsible for alleged wrong ##ful conduct by hosts who engage in short - term rental ##s . claims in such cases have alleged illegal hotel conversions , real estate license requirements , violations of municipal law around short - term o ##cc ##up ##ancy or rental ##s , unlawful ev ##iction ##s , or violations of lease provisions or home ##own ##ers ’ association rules . legal claims have been asserted for alleged disc ##rim ##inatory conduct undertaken by hosts against certain guests , and for our own platform policies or business practices . changes to the interpretation of the app ##lica ##bility of fair housing , civil rights or other statutes to our business or the conduct of our users could material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business , results of operations , and financial condition . we may also become more vulnerable to third - party claims as u . s . laws such as the digital millennium copyright act ( “ d ##mc ##a ” ) , the stored communications act , and the communications dec ##ency act ( “ cd ##a ” ) , and non - u . s . laws such as the european e - commerce directive and its national trans ##position ##s are interpreted by the courts or otherwise modified or amended , as our platform and services to our hosts and guests continue to expand , and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online inter ##media ##ries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable .

[CLS] we could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform . [SEP]
[CLS] we could face claims relating to information or content that is made available on our platform . our platform relies upon content that is created and posted by hosts , guests , or other third parties . although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties , and not by us , claims of defamation , di ##spar ##age ##ment , negligence , warrant ##y , personal harm , intellectual property infringement , or other alleged damages could be asserted against us , in addition to our hosts and guests . while we rely on a variety of statutory and common - law framework ##s and defenses , including those provided by the d ##mc ##a , the cd ##a , the fair - use doctrine and various tor ##t law defenses in the united states and the e - commerce directive in the european union , differences between statutes , limitations on immunity or responsibility , requirements to maintain immunity or proportion ##ate responsibility , and mode ##ration efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these framework ##s and defenses , or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by hosts and guests or otherwise contributed by third - parties to our platform . moreover , regulators in the united states and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on our platform . for example , in the united states , laws such as the cd ##a , which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers , may change and become less predictable or un ##fa ##vor ##able by legislative action or ju ##rid ##ical interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been various federal legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the cd ##a , in particular with regards to section 230 of the cd ##a , and current protections from liability for third - party content in the united states could decrease or change . there is proposed u . s . federal legislation seeking to hold platforms liable for user - generated content , including content related to short - term rental ##s . we could inc ##ur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and , if we are found liable , significant damages . the european union is also reviewing the regulation of digital services , and in december 2020 , the european commission published a draft of the proposed digital services act ( “ ds ##a ” ) , a package of legislation intended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms , products , and services , which could negatively impact the scope of the limited immunity provided by the e - commerce directive . some european jurisdictions have also proposed or intend to pass legislation that impose ##s new obligations and lia ##bilities on platforms with respect to certain types of harmful content . in parallel , the european commission also published a legislative proposal to introduce new ex ant ##e regulation of online platforms and new market investigation powers as a separate piece of legislation , the digital markets act ( “ d ##ma ” ) . if the d ##ma is enacted , it may contain certain regulatory requirements and / or obligations that negatively impact our business . some european jurisdictions ( such as the united kingdom and germany ) are also reviewing their competition rules in relation to digital platforms which could lead to new regulations similar to the d ##ma at national level . while the scope and timing of these proposals are currently evolving , if enacted and applied to our platform , the new rules may adverse ##ly affect our business . in countries in asia and latin america , generally there are not similar statutes as the cd ##a or e - commerce directive . the laws of countries in asia and latin america generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down . further , laws in some asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability , which can include criminal liability , if a platform failed to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded . because liability often flows from information or content on our platform and / or services accessed through our platform , as we continue to expand our offerings , tier ##s , and scope of business , both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations , we may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations . our [SEP]

[CLS] home sharing may not achieve global acceptance . [SEP]
[CLS] while home sharing has grown in popularity , home sharing may not achieve global acceptance , particularly in regions where home sharing may not be deemed attractive to hosts and guests due to cultural considerations . the attractive ##ness of our platform for hosts and guests is impacted by a number of factors , including the willingness of individual hosts to offer their homes on our platform , the willingness of guests to book stays at homes in lieu of more traditional options , such as hotels , our ability to continue to extend our operating model internationally and offer localized services that are desirable to our hosts and guests , and our ability to offer cost - effective alternatives to traditional accommodations . furthermore , both hosts and guests may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform because of concerns regarding their safety or the quality of their stays . many hosts and guests are app ##re ##hen ##sive about or not willing to share homes due to concerns surrounding the transmission of co ##vid - 19 , and if they are willing to share homes , their ability to do so may be restricted by laws , rules , regulations , or decrees adopted in response to the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . [SEP]
[CLS] this uncertainty surrounding acceptance of home sharing is ex ##ace ##rba ##ted by the legacy system of laws and regulations that govern short and long - term accommodations , travel services , real estate broker ##age services , and taxes , which generally does not directly address the online home sharing business model . if home sharing does not achieve global acceptance , our growth could be limited , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] any incident , whether actual or rumored to have occurred , involving the safety or security of listings , hosts , guests , or other members of the public , fraudulent transactions , or incidents that are mistakenly attributed to air ##bn ##b , and any media coverage resulting there ##fr ##om , could create a negative public perception of our platform , which would adverse ##ly impact our ability to attract hosts and guests . in addition , when hosts cancel reservations or if we fail to provide timely ref ##unds to guests in connection with cancellation ##s , guest perception of the value of our platform is adverse ##ly impacted and may cause guests to not use our platform in the future . the impact of these issues may be more pronounced if we are seen to have failed to provide prompt and appropriate community support or our platform policies are perceived to be too per ##missive , too restrictive , or providing hosts and / or guests with un ##sat ##is ##factory resolutions . we have been the subject of media reports , social media posts , blogs , and other forums that contain allegations about our business or activity on our platform that create negative publicity . as a result of these complaints and negative publicity , some hosts have refrain ##ed from , and may in the future refrain from , listing with us , and some guests have refrain ##ed from , and may in the future refrain from , using our platform , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] in addition , our brand and reputation could be harmed if we fail to act res ##pon ##si ##bly or are perceived as not acting res ##pon ##si ##bly , or fail to comply with regulatory requirements as interpreted by certain governments or agencies thereof , in a number of other areas , such as safety and security , data security , privacy practices , provision of information about users and activities on our platform , sustainability , human rights , diversity , non - discrimination , and support for employees and local communities . media , legislative , or government scrutiny around our company , including the perceived impact on affordable housing and over - tourism , neighborhood nu ##isance , privacy practices , provision of information as requested by certain governments or agencies thereof , content on our platform , business practices and strategic plans , impact of travel on the environment , and public health policies that may cause geo ##pol ##itical backlash , our business partners , private companies where we have minority investments , and our practices relating to our platform , offerings , employees , competition , litigation , and response to regulatory activity , could adverse ##ly affect our brand and our reputation with our hosts , guests , and communities . social media compounds the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated and the speed with which such negative publicity may spread . any resulting damage to our brand or reputation could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] in addition , we rely on our hosts and guests to provide trust ##worthy reviews and ratings that our hosts or guests may rely upon to help decide whether or not to book a particular listing or accept a particular booking and that we use to enforce quality standards . we rely on these reviews to further strengthen trust among members of our community . our hosts and guests may be less likely to rely on reviews and ratings if they believe that our review system does not generate trust ##worthy reviews and ratings . we have procedures in place to combat fraud or abuse of our review system , but we cannot guarantee that these procedures are or will be effective . in addition , if our hosts and guests do not leave reliable reviews and ratings , other potential hosts or guests may disregard those reviews and ratings , and our systems that use reviews and ratings to enforce quality standards would be less effective , which could reduce trust within our community and damage our brand and reputation , and could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] while we recognize that we need to continue to build trust and invest in innovations that will support trust when it comes to our policies , tools , and procedures to protect hosts , guests , and the communities in which our hosts operate , we may not be successful in doing so . similarly , listings that are inaccurate , of a lower than expected quality , or that do not comply with our policies may harm guests and public perception of the quality and safety of listings on our platform and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] if criminal , inappropriate , fraudulent , or other negative incidents continue to occur due to the conduct of hosts , guests , or third parties , our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests would be harmed , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . such incidents have prompted , and may in the future prompt , strict ##er home sharing regulations or regulatory inquiries into our platform policies and business practices . in the united states and other countries , we have seen listings being used for parties in violation of air ##bn ##b ’ s policies which have in some cases resulted in neighborhood disruption or violence . further , claims have been asserted against us from our hosts , guests , and third parties for compensation due to fatalities , accidents , injuries , assaults , theft , property damage , privacy and security issues , fraudulent listings , and other incidents that are caused by other hosts , guests , or third parties while using our platform . these claims subject us to potentially significant liability and increase our operating costs and could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . we have obtained some third - party insurance , which is subject to certain conditions and exclusion ##s , for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to booking ##s on our platform . even where we do have third - party insurance , such insurance may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability , investigation costs , defense costs , and / or pay ##outs . even if these claims do not result in liability , we could inc ##ur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them . as we expand our offerings and tier ##s , such as the addition of air ##bn ##b experiences , or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases , our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow , which would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] measures that we are taking to improve the trust and safety of our platform may cause us to inc ##ur significant expenditures and may not be successful . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] our brand marketing efforts include a variety of online and off ##line marketing distribution channels . our brand marketing efforts are expensive and may not be cost - effective or successful . for example , in november 2019 , we announced a partnership with the international olympic committee for nine years to cover the next five olympic games . the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has delayed the 2020 olympics , and the continued uncertainty around co ##vid - 19 and other geo ##pol ##itical factors could undermine our ability to realize the value of the partnership . if our competitors spend increasingly more on brand marketing efforts , we may not be able to maintain and grow traffic to our platform . [SEP]
[CLS] we have used performance marketing products offered by search engines and social media platforms to distribute paid advertisements that drive traffic to our platform . the remainder of our traffic comes through direct or unpaid channels , which include brand marketing and search engine optimization ( “ seo ” ) . a critical factor in attracting hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search que ##ries for key search terms . the success of home sharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant key ##words as our competitors competitive ##ly bid on our key ##words , including our brand name . our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019 . however , we may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth cost - effectively . if we are not able to effectively increase our traffic growth without increases in spend on performance marketing , we may need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future , including in response to increased spend on performance marketing from our competitors , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] the technology that powers much of our performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation , and regulatory or legislative changes could adverse ##ly impact the effectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and , as a result , our business . for example , we rely on the placement and use of “ cookies ” — text files stored on a host or guest ’ s web browser or device — to support tailored marketing to consumers . many countries have adopted , or are in the process of adopting , regulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies , and individuals may be required to “ opt - in ” to the placement of cookies used for purposes of marketing . for example , we are subject to evolving eu privacy laws on cookies and e - marketing . in the european union , regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem , and current national laws that implement the ep ##ri ##vac ##y directive are likely to be replaced by an eu regulation , known as the ep ##ri ##vac ##y regulation , which will significantly increase fines for non - compliance . in the european union , informed consent may be required for the placement of a cookie on a user ’ s device and for direct electronic marketing . the gdp ##r also impose ##s conditions on obtaining valid consent , such as a prohibition on pre - checked consent ##s and a requirement to ensure separate consent ##s are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology . while the text of the ep ##ri ##vac ##y regulation is still under development , a recent european court of justice decision and regulators ’ recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies under existing law . if regulators start to enforce the strict approach , this could lead to substantial costs , require significant systems changes , limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities , divert the attention of our technology personnel , adverse ##ly affect our margins , increase costs , and subject us to additional lia ##bilities . widespread adoption of regulations that significantly restrict our ability to use performance marketing technology could adverse ##ly affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective hosts and guests , and thus material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we focus on unpaid channels such as seo . seo involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search que ##ries for which our platform ’ s content may be relevant . changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control , and could adverse ##ly affect our search - engine rankings and traffic to our platform . we believe that our seo results have been adverse ##ly affected by the launch of google travel and google vacation rental ads , which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel - related terms and placement on google . to the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason , we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . if google or apple uses its own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings , or impose policies that effectively di ##sal ##low us to continue our full product offerings in those channels , there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage with hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , as guests increase their booking activity across multiple travel sites or compare offerings across sites , our marketing efficiency and effectiveness is adverse ##ly impacted , which could cause us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures in the future , which may not be offset by additional revenue , and could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . in addition , any negative publicity or public complaints , including those that imp ##ede our ability to maintain positive brand awareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts , could harm our reputation and lead to fewer hosts and guests using our platform , and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures . [SEP]
[CLS] our debt obligations contain restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our liquid ##ity and financial condition . if we require additional funding to support our business , this additional funding may not be available on reasonable terms , or at all . [SEP]
[CLS] we have outstanding long - term ind ##eb ##ted ##ness with a principal amount of $ 1 , 99 ##5 . 0 million as of december 31 , 2020 . in addition , we entered into a five - year revolving credit facility in november 2020 with $ 500 . 0 million of initial borrowing commitments ( “ 2020 credit facility ” ) and as of december 31 , 2020 , there were no borrowing ##s outstanding under the 2020 credit facility . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had total outstanding letters of credit of $ 54 . 3 million . the agreements governing our ind ##eb ##ted ##ness ( our “ credit agreements ” ) contain various [SEP]

[CLS] if we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in these “ risk factors ” or otherwise , we could have difficulty paying interest and the principal amount of our outstanding ind ##eb ##ted ##ness . if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under our credit agreements , or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our ind ##eb ##ted ##ness , we could default under our credit agreements . any such default that is not cured or waived could result in an acceleration of ind ##eb ##ted ##ness then outstanding under our credit agreements , a requirement that we and our subsidiaries that have guaranteed our ind ##eb ##ted ##ness pay the obligations in full , and would permit the lend ##ers to exercise re ##med ##ies with respect to all of the collateral that is securing our ind ##eb ##ted ##ness , including substantially all of our and our subsidiary gu ##aran ##tors ’ assets . in addition , lend ##ers may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with funding under the 2020 credit facility . we cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenant ##s in our credit agreements or to remedy any default ##s under our credit agreements . [SEP]
[CLS] interest rates under our credit agreements are based partly on li ##bor , the london inter ##bank offered rate , which is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london inter ##bank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally . li ##bor is currently expected to phase out by the end of 2021 . it is unclear if at that time li ##bor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating li ##bor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 . the u . s . federal reserve has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to li ##bor . if the method for calculation of li ##bor changes , if li ##bor is no longer available , or if lend ##ers have increased costs due to changes in li ##bor , we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowing ##s . further , we may need to rene ##go ##tia ##te our credit agreements or any other borrowing ##s that utilize li ##bor as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace li ##bor with the new standard that is established . [SEP]
[CLS] since the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , there has been increased vol ##ati ##lity in the financial and securities markets , which has generally made access to capital less certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital . as we manage through the slow ##down in our business due to the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us on reasonable terms , or at all . in addition , the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenant ##s , which could further restrict our business operations . if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them , our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] our substantial level of ind ##eb ##ted ##ness could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our financial condition . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the factors listed above , we have invested heavily to expand our operations in china , which is an intensely competitive market , both on the consumer side and from a talent perspective . we expect to continue to inc ##ur significant expenses to operate our business in china , and we may not achieve profit ##ability in that market . as we expand our operations in china , the above factors , sentiment of the workforce in china , and china ’ s policy towards foreign direct investment may particularly impact our operations in china . further , as we expand our operations in china , we expect to continue to make modifications to the way our website , mobile apps , offerings , and features function in china as compared to other countries . in addition , we need to ensure that our business practices in china are compliant with local laws and regulations , which may be interpreted and enforced in ways that are different from our interpretation , and / or create obligations on us that are costly to meet or conflict with laws in other jurisdictions . [SEP]
[CLS] as we disclose to our hosts and guests regarding china , we are subject to various requirements and requests from government agencies to share information on users who use or offer services in china through our platform . failure to comply with such requests or other requirements as interpreted by government agencies may lead to impairment or disruption to our business and operations , including failing to obtain or losing the necessary licenses to operate in china , the blocking of our platform and services in china , and / or enforcement action against our host community , corporate entities or officers . our failure to comply with such requests or requirements , or conversely our compliance with such requests or requirements , could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our brand , reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition . further , given that our headquarters is in the united states , any significant or prolonged deterioration in u . s . - china bilateral relations or es ##cala ##tion of geo - political risk in china could adverse ##ly affect our business .

[CLS] we conduct our business in china through a variable interest entity ( “ vie ” ) and a wholly - foreign owned entity . we do not own shares in our vie and instead rely on contractual arrangements with the equity holders of our vie to operate our business in china because foreign investment is restricted or prohibited . under our contractual arrangements , we must rely on the vie and the vie equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the vie . the vie equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us or our stock ##holders , and they may not act in our best interests or may not perform their obligations under these contracts . if our vie or its equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements , we may not be able to enforce our rights . in addition , if the chinese government dee ##ms that the contractual arrangements in relation to our vie do not comply with chinese governmental restrictions on foreign investment , or if these regulations or their interpretation changes in the future , we could be subject to penalties , be forced to cease our operations in china , or be subject to restrictions in the future , and we may inc ##ur additional compliance costs . the contractual arrangements with our vie may also be subject to scrutiny by the chinese tax authorities and any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes .

[CLS] we track certain operational metric ##s , which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement , and real or perceived ina ##cc ##ura ##cies in such metric ##s may harm our reputation and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our stock price , business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we track certain operational metric ##s , including metric ##s such as nights and experiences booked , gb ##v , active listings , active booker ##s , hosts , and guest arrivals , which may differ from estimates or similar metric ##s published by third parties due to differences in sources , method ##ologies , or the assumptions on which we rely . our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations , and our method ##ologies for tracking these metric ##s may change over time , which could result in unexpected changes to our metric ##s , including the metric ##s we publicly disclose . if the internal systems and tools we use to track these metric ##s under ##co ##unt or over ##co ##unt performance or contain algorithm ##ic or other technical errors , the data we report may not be accurate . while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metric ##s for the applicable period of measurement , there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations globally . [SEP]
[CLS] our nights and experiences booked and gb ##v metric ##s are adjusted for cancellation ##s and alterations that happen in the reporting period . however , cancellation ##s and alterations for booking ##s made in the reporting period can occur beyond the current reporting period . this results in a reported amount of nights and experiences booked and gb ##v in the quarter of the booking for which all of the booking ##s may ultimately not result in check - ins , and subsequently reduces our nights and experiences booked and gb ##v metric ##s in subsequent quarters when we experience cancellation ##s . cancellation ##s and alterations to previously booked trips increased dramatically after the co ##vid - 19 outbreak , as guests were either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling . while the number of nights and experiences canceled in january 2020 was 13 % of the gross nights and experiences booked that month , the number of nights and experiences canceled in march and april 2020 exceeded the number of gross nights and experiences booked during those months . if we experience high levels of cancellation ##s in the future , our performance and related business metric ##s will be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] the calculation of nights and experiences booked , gb ##v , and active listings requires the ongoing collection of data on new offerings that are added to our platform over time . our business is complex , and the methodology used to calculate nights and experiences booked , gb ##v , and active listings may require future adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings . [SEP]
[CLS] an active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period . certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active booker ##s . we count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of hosts with an available listing as of a certain date . some individuals may have more than one host account and therefore may be counted more than once as hosts . [SEP]
[CLS] our metric ##s , including our reported nights and experiences booked , gb ##v , and active listings , may include fraudulent booking ##s , accounts , and other activities that have not been flag ##ged by our trust and safety teams or identified by our machine learning algorithms or not yet addressed by our operational teams , which could mean these activities on our site are not identified or addressed in a timely manner or at all , reducing the accuracy of our metric ##s . further , any such fraudulent activity , along with associated ref ##unds and cancellation ##s , would reduce our metric ##s , in particular nights and experiences booked , gb ##v , and active listings , in the quarter in which it is discovered . limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business , which could affect our long - term strategies . if our operational metric ##s are not accurate representations of our business , or if investors do not perceive these metric ##s to be accurate , or if we discover material ina ##cc ##ura ##cies with respect to these figures , our reputation may be significantly harmed , our stock price could decline , we may be subject to stock ##holder litigation , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] our efforts to create new offerings and initiatives are costly , and if we are unable to successfully pursue such offerings and initiatives , we may fail to grow , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] we need to continue to invest in the development of new offerings and initiatives that differentiate us from our competitors , such as air ##bn ##b experiences . developing and delivering these new offerings and initiatives increase our expenses and our organizational complexity , and we may experience difficulties in developing and implementing these new offerings and initiatives . [SEP]
[CLS] our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk , as they may involve un ##pro ##ven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience . there can be no assurance that consumer demand for such offerings and initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anti ##ci ##pate , that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives , or that any of these offerings or initiatives will gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or lia ##bilities . it is also possible that offerings developed by others will render our offerings and initiatives non ##com ##pet ##itive or obsolete . further , these efforts en ##tail investments in our systems and infrastructure , payments platform , and increased legal and regulatory compliance expenses , could distract management from current operations , and will divert capital and other resources [SEP]

[CLS] from our more established offerings and geo ##graph ##ies . even if we are successful in developing new offerings and initiatives , regulatory authorities may subject us or our hosts and guests to new rules , taxes , or restrictions or more aggressively enforce existing rules , taxes , or restrictions , that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercial ##izing these initiatives . if we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments , we may fail to grow and our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] if we fail to comply with federal , state , and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection , we may face potentially significant liability , negative publicity , an erosion of trust , and increased regulation could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] privacy and data protection laws , rules , and regulations are complex , and their interpretation is rapidly evolving , making implementation and enforcement , and thus compliance requirements , ambiguous , uncertain , and potentially inconsistent . compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection , use , transfer , disclosure , other processing , and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business . as part of host and guest registration and business processes , we collect and use personal data , such as names , dates of birth , email addresses , phone numbers , and identity verification information ( for example , government issued identification or passport ) , as well as credit card or other financial information that hosts and guests provide to us . the laws of many states and countries require businesses that maintain such personal data to implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the gdp ##r , which became effective on may 25 , 2018 , has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burden ##s and costs for companies like ours . the gdp ##r regulates our collection , control , processing , sharing , disclosure , and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual ( “ personal data ” ) , and impose ##s string ##ent data protection requirements with significant penalties , and the risk of civil litigation , for non ##com ##pl ##iance . [SEP]
[CLS] failure to comply with the gdp ##r may result in fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 % of the annual global revenue of the in ##fr ##inger , whichever is greater . it may also lead to civil litigation , with the risks of damages or in ##jun ##ctive relief , or regulatory orders adverse ##ly impact ##ing on the ways in which our business can use personal data . many large geo ##graph ##ies , which are important to our success , including australia , brazil , canada , china , and india , have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy legislation or regulation , which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , from january 1 , 2021 ( when the transitional period following br ##ex ##it expired ) , we are subject to the gdp ##r and also the uk gdp ##r , both regimes having the ability to fine up to the greater of 20 million euros ( 17 million british pounds ) or 4 % of global turnover , respectively . the relationship between the united kingdom and the european union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear , for example , how data transfers between eu member states and the united kingdom will be treated and the role of the united kingdom ’ s information commissioner ’ s office with respect to the european union . currently there is a four to six - month grace period agreed in the european union and uk trade and cooperation agreement , ending june 30 , 2021 at the latest , while the parties discuss an ad ##e ##qua ##cy decision . however , it is not clear whether ( and when ) an ad ##e ##qua ##cy decision may be granted by the european commission enabling data transfers from european union member states to the united kingdom long term without additional measures . these changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , we are subject to laws , rules , and regulations regarding cross - border transfers of personal data , including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the european economic area ( “ ee ##a ” ) . recent legal developments in europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the ee ##a to the united states and other jurisdictions ; for example , on july 16 , 2020 , the c ##je ##u invalid ##ated the eu - us privacy shield framework ( “ privacy shield ” ) under which personal data could be transferred from the ee ##a to us entities that had self - certified under the privacy shield scheme . while the c ##je ##u upheld the ad ##e ##qua ##cy of the standard contractual clauses ( a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism , and potential alternative to the privacy shield ) , it noted that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances ; this has created uncertainty and increased the risk around our international operations . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to other mechanisms ( particularly standard contractual clauses ) , we previously relied on our own privacy shield certification and , in limited instances , the privacy shield certification ##s of third parties ( for example , vendors and partners ) for the purposes of transferring personal data from the ee ##a to the united states . we continue to rely on the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data outside the ee ##a , including to the united states . additionally , in certain circumstances , we rely on der ##oga ##tions provided for by law . these recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and , or , receive personal data transfers to the united states and other jurisdictions . as our lead supervisory authorities ( the irish data protection commission , the luxembourg national commission for data protection and , until the end of 2020 , the british ic ##o ) , the european data protection board , and other data protection regulators issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms , including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used , and / or start taking enforcement action , we could suffer additional costs , complaints and / or regulatory investigations or fines , and / or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate , it could affect the manner in which we provide our services , the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations , and could adverse ##ly affect our financial results .

[CLS] in the united states , federal law , such as the gram ##m - leach - b ##li ##ley act of 1999 ( “ g ##lb ##a ” ) and its implementing regulations , restrict ##s certain collection , processing , storage , use , and disclosure of personal information , requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain non ##pu ##bl ##ic or otherwise legally protected information . these rules also impose requirements for the safeguard ##ing and proper destruction of personal information through the iss ##uance of data security standards or guidelines . the u . s . government , including congress , the federal trade commission and the department of commerce , has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet , including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices . numerous states have enacted or are in the process of en ##act ##ing state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection , use , and processing of state residents ’ personal [SEP]

[CLS] data . for example , the california consumer privacy act ( “ cc ##pa ” ) took effect on january 1 , 2020 . the cc ##pa establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours , and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and inc ##ur compliance related costs and expenses . the cc ##pa provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to california residents , such as afford ##ing consumers the right to access and del ##ete their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information . the law also prohibits covered businesses from disc ##rim ##inating against consumers ( for example , charging more for services ) for exercising any of their cc ##pa rights . the cc ##pa impose ##s severe statutory damages as well as a private right of action for certain data breach ##es that result in the loss of personal information . this private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of , and risks associated with , data breach litigation . it remains unclear how various provisions of the cc ##pa will be interpreted and enforced . in november 2020 , california voters passed the california privacy rights and enforcement act of 2020 ( “ cp ##ra ” ) . the cp ##ra further expands the cc ##pa with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business , and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements . the cp ##ra and the cc ##pa may lead other states to pass comparable legislation , with potentially greater penalties , and more rigorous compliance requirements relevant to our business . the effects of the cp ##ra , the cc ##pa , and other similar state or federal laws , are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to inc ##ur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation . [SEP]
[CLS] various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and many have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically . compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult and costly for an online business such as ours , which collects personal information from hosts , guests , and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions . if any jurisdiction in which we operate adopt ##s news laws or changes its interpretation of its laws , rules , or regulations relating to data residency or local ##ization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all , we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions . while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with gdp ##r , g ##lb ##a , cc ##pa , and other privacy regulations around the world , many of these regulations expose us to the possibility of material penalties , significant legal liability , changes in how we operate or offer our products , and interruption ##s or ce ##ssa ##tion of our ability to operate in key geo ##graph ##ies , any of which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , to improve the trust and safety on our platform , we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our hosts , guests , and listings in certain jurisdictions . such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the internet , access ##ing public databases such as court records , utilizing third - party vendors to analyze host or guest data , or physical inspection . these types of activities may expose us to the risk of regulatory enforcement from privacy regulators and civil litigation . [SEP]
[CLS] when we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies , including tax authorities , state and city regulators , law enforcement agencies , and intelligence agencies , our hosts , guests , and privacy regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies , notices , and laws , which could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions . conversely , if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law , we are likely to face enforcement action from such government , engage in litigation , face increased regulatory scrutiny , and experience an adverse impact on our relationship with governments or our ability to offer our services within certain jurisdictions . any of the fore ##going could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our brand , reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our business also increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and automated decision making to improve our services and tailor our interactions with our customers . however , in recent years use of these methods has come under increased regulatory scrutiny . new laws , guidance and / or decisions in this area may limit our ability to use our artificial intelligence models , or require us to make changes to our operations that may decrease our operational efficiency , result in an increase to operating costs and / or hind ##er our ability to improve our services . for example , there are specific rules on the use of automated decision making under the gdp ##r that require the existence of automated decision making to be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances , and safeguard ##s must be implemented to safeguard individual rights , including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision . further , california recently introduced a law requiring disclosure of chat ##bot functionality . [SEP]
[CLS] any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies , enforcement notices and / or assessment notices ( for a compulsory audit ) , laws , rules , and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals , consumer rights groups , government agencies , or others . we may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation ( where individuals have suffered harm ) , potentially amount ##ing to significant compensation or damages lia ##bilities , as well as associated costs , and diversion of internal resources . we could inc ##ur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and , if found liable , pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business . further , these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity , and an erosion of trust . if any of these events were to occur , our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] if we fail to prevent data security breach ##es , there may be damage to our brand and reputation , material financial penalties , and legal liability , along with a decline in use of our platform , which would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] there are risks of security breach ##es both on and off our systems as we increase the types of technology we use to operate our platform , including mobile apps and third - party payment processing providers , and as we collaborate with third parties that may need to process our host or guest data or have access to our infrastructure . the evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against . an increasing number of companies , including those with significant online operations , have recently disclosed breach ##es of their security , some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly at ##tri ##bu ##table to criminal enterprises or nation - state actors . while we take significant measures to guard against the type of activity that can lead to data breach ##es , the techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access , di ##sable or de ##grade service , or sabotage systems change frequently and [SEP]

[CLS] often are unknown until launched against a target . as such , we may be unable to anti ##ci ##pate these tactics and techniques or to implement adequate prevent ##ative measures . [SEP]
[CLS] further , with a large geographically di ##spar ##ate employee base , we are not immune from the possibility of a malicious insider com ##promising our information systems and infrastructure . this risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work as a response to the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . we also have a distributed community support organization including third - party providers that have access to personal information . we and other companies in our industry have dealt with incidents involving such insider ##s ex ##fi ##lt ##rating the personal data of customers , stealing corporate trade secrets and key financial metric ##s , and illegally divert ##ing funds . no series of measures can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , bad actors have targeted and will continue to target our hosts and guests directly with attempts to breach the security of their email accounts or management systems , such as through phi ##shing attacks where a third party attempts to infiltrate our systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate inquiry or electronic communication , which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate emails from us or from our hosts or guests , partners , or vendors . we have seen many instances of our hosts and guests falling prey to such schemes , which result in their accounts being taken over by fraud ##sters intent on per ##pet ##rating fraud against them , other users , and our platform . bad actors may also employ other schemes aimed at def ##ra ##uding our hosts or guests in ways that we may not anti ##ci ##pate or be able to adequately guard against . even if phi ##shing and spa ##mming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through our systems , victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us . because of our prominence , we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks . though it is difficult to determine what , if any , harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack , any failure to maintain performance , reliability , security , and availability of our offerings , services , and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our hosts and guests may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing hosts and guests and attract new hosts and guests . the ability of fraud ##sters to directly target our hosts and guests with fraudulent communications , or cause an account takeover , expose ##s us to significant financial fraud risk , including costly litigation , which is difficult to fully mit ##igate . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , our practice is to en ##cr ##yp ##t certain sensitive data when it is in transit and at rest . however , we do not know whether our current practice will be deemed sufficient under applicable laws or whether new regulatory requirements might make our current practice insufficient . moreover , the existence of encryption , in - and - of itself , is not a completely perfect security solution . if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that certain personal data has been ex ##fi ##lt ##rated , accessed , or used inappropriate ##ly , we may need to inform the host or guest whose data was stolen , accessed , or used , and may be subject to significant fines and penalties . further , under certain regulatory schemes , such as the cc ##pa , we may be liable for statutory damages on a per breached record basis , ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of any actual damages or harm to the individual . this means that in the event of a breach we could face government scrutiny or consumer class actions alleging statutory damages amount ##ing to hundreds of millions , and possibly billions of dollars . [SEP]
[CLS] our information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic intrusion ##s that our security measures may not detect . we have experienced security incidents in the past , and we may face additional attempted security intrusion ##s in the future . any ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##ion of our security measures could result in the mis ##app ##ropriation of confidential or proprietary information , interrupt our operations , result in financial loss , damage our computers or those of our hosts and guests , or otherwise cause damage to our reputation and business . further , the ability to bypass our information security controls could de ##grade our trust and safety programs , which could expose individuals to a risk of physical harm or violence . [SEP]
[CLS] we rely on third - party service providers , including financial institutions , to process some of our data and that of our hosts and guests , including payment information , and any failure by such third parties to prevent or mit ##igate security breach ##es or improper access to , or disclosure of , such information could have adverse consequences for us similar to an incident directly on our systems . [SEP]
[CLS] we have acquired and will continue to acquire companies that are vulnerable to security breach ##es , and we are responsible for any security breach ##es of these newly acquired companies . while we conduct due dil ##igen ##ce of these companies , we do not have access to the full operating history of the companies and cannot be certain there have not been security breach ##es prior to our acquisition . [SEP]
[CLS] we ex ##pen ##d , and expect to continue to ex ##pen ##d , significant resources to protect against security related incidents and address problems caused by such incidents . even if we were to ex ##pen ##d more resources , regulators and complain ##ants may not dee ##m our efforts sufficient , and regardless of the expenditure , the risk of security related incidents cannot be fully mit ##igate ##d . we have a heightened risk of security breach ##es due to some of our operations being located in certain international jurisdictions . any actual or alleged security breach ##es or alleged violations of federal , state , or foreign laws or regulations relating to privacy and data security could result in mandated user notification ##s , litigation , government investigations , significant fines , and expenditures ; divert management ’ s attention from operations ; deter people from using our platform ; damage our brand and reputation ; force us to cease operations for some length of time ; and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident , regardless of their merit , will be costly and may cause reputation harm . the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage , denial of coverage as to any specific claim , or any change or ce ##ssa ##tion in our insurance policies and coverage ##s , including premium increases or the imp ##osition of large de ##du ##ct ##ible requirements , could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] our platform is highly complex , and any und ##ete ##cted errors could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our platform is a complex system composed of many inter ##oper ##ating components and software . our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform and to effectively implement updates to our systems . our software , including open source software that is incorporated into our code , may now or in the future contain und ##ete ##cted errors , bugs , or vu ##ln ##era ##bilities . some errors in our software code have not been and may not be discovered until after the code has been released . we have , from time to time , found defects or errors in our system and software limitations that have resulted in , and may discover additional issues in the future that could result in , platform una ##va ##ila ##bility or system disruption , or the inability of our systems to implement timely updates that are required for regulatory compliance . for example , defects or errors have resulted in and could result in the delay in making payments to hosts or over ##pa ##ying or [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] system capacity constraints , system or operational failures , or denial - of - service or other attacks could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] since our founding , we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform . if our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform , we could experience una ##nti ##ci ##pate ##d disruption ##s in service , slower response times , decreased customer satisfaction , and delays in the introduction of new offerings and tier ##s . it may be particularly difficult for us to manage these issues during the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and the related governmental ##ly mandated shelter at home orders , as a result of which few , if any , of our employees are physically present in our headquarters . [SEP]
[CLS] our corporate headquarters , a significant portion of our research and development activities , and certain other critical business operations are located in san francisco , built on a high - risk li ##que ##fa ##ction zone and is near major earthquake fault lines . our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error , computer viruses , earthquakes , floods , fires , power loss , and similar events . in addition , northern california has recently experienced , and may continue to experience power out ##ages during the fire season and our headquarters does not have power generator backup to maintain full business continuity . a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our headquarters , any third - party cloud hosting facilities , or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and result in lengthy interruption ##s or delays of our platform and services . [SEP]
[CLS] our systems and operations are also subject to break - ins , sabotage , intentional acts of van ##dal ##ism , terrorism , and similar misconduct from external sources and malicious insider ##s . our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems , and any such attack could cause significant interruption ##s in our operations . for instance , from time to time , we have experienced denial - of - service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time . there are numerous other potential forms of attack , such as phi ##shing , account takeover ##s , malicious code injection ##s , ransom ##ware , and the attempted use of our platform to launch a denial - of - service attack against another party , each of which could cause significant interruption ##s in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings . reductions in the availability and response time of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bon ##a fide customers . these issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer , and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available . successful attacks could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation , and could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack , any of which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in the event of certain system failures , we may not be able to switch to back - up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged . we have experienced system failures from time to time . in addition to placing increased burden ##s on our engineering staff , these out ##ages create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our community support team . any un ##sche ##du ##led interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue , an increase in community support costs , and harm our reputation , and could result in some consumers switching to our competitors . if we experience frequent or persistent system failures , our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . while we have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and red ##unda ##ncy of our systems , these steps are expensive and may not be completely effective in reducing the frequency or duration of un ##sche ##du ##led down ##time . we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur . [SEP]
[CLS] we use both internally developed systems and third - party systems to operate our platform , including transaction and payment processing , and financial and accounting systems . if the number of consumers using our platform increases substantially , or if critical third - party systems stop operating as designed , we may need to significantly upgrade , expand , or repair our transaction and payment processing systems , financial and accounting systems , and other infrastructure . we may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner , and depending on the systems affected , our transaction and payment processing , and financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our business depends on the performance and reliability of the internet , mobile , telecommunications network operators , and other infrastructure ##s that are not under our control . as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices , we also become dependent on consumers ’ access to the internet through mobile carriers and their systems . disruption ##s in internet access , whether generally , in a specific region or otherwise , could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts , guests , or platform could increase our tax lia ##bilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform . [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the united states ( federal , state , and local ) and numerous foreign jurisdictions . we have received communications from numerous foreign , federal , state , and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our hosts and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions [SEP]

[CLS] against our hosts and guests . in many jurisdictions where applicable , we have agreed to collect and re ##mit taxes on behalf of our hosts . we have been subject to complaints by , and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by , certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct and indirect taxes . in some jurisdictions we are in dispute with respect to past and future taxes . a number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various taxes to businesses like ours . laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform , and to our hosts and guests , vary greatly among jurisdictions , and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied . [SEP]
[CLS] the application of indirect taxes , such as lodging taxes , hotel , sales and use tax , privilege taxes , ex ##cise taxes , va ##t , goods and services tax , harmon ##ized sales taxes , business tax , and gross receipt taxes ( together , “ indirect taxes ” ) to e - commerce activities such as ours and to our hosts or guests is a complex and evolving issue . some of such tax laws or regulations hold us responsible for the reporting , collection , and payment of such taxes , and such laws could be applied to us for transactions conducted in the past as well as transactions in the future . many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and e - commerce . new or revised foreign , federal , state , or local tax regulations may subject us or our hosts and guests to additional indirect , income , and other taxes , and depending upon the jurisdiction could subject us or our hosts and guests to significant monetary penalties and fines for non - payment of taxes . an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering adopting or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures , including digital platform revenue - based taxes , targeting online sharing platforms and online marketplace ##s , and new obligations to collect host income taxes , sales , consumption , value added , or other taxes on digital platforms . we may recognize additional tax expenses and be subject to additional tax lia ##bilities , and our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected by additional taxes of this nature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from our failure to comply with any reporting , collection , and payment obligations . we acc ##ru ##e a reserve for such taxes when the likelihood is probable that such taxes apply to us , and upon examination or audit , such reserves may be insufficient . [SEP]
[CLS] new or revised taxes and , in particular , the taxes described above and similar taxes would likely increase the price paid by guests , the cost of doing business for our hosts , discourage hosts and guests from using our platform , and lead to a decline in revenue , and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . if we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies for tax reporting purposes , our hosts , guests , and regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies , notices , and laws and commence proceedings or actions against us . if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law , we are likely to face enforcement action , engage in litigation , face increased regulatory scrutiny , and experience an adverse impact in our relationships with governments . our competitors may arrive at different or novel solutions to the application of taxes to analogous businesses that could cause our hosts and guests to leave our platform in favor of conducting business on the platforms of our competitors . this uncertainty around the application of taxes and the impact of those taxes on the actual or perceived value of our platform may also cause guests to use ot ##as , hotels , or other traditional travel services . any of these events could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our brand , reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we devote significant resources , including management time , to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply . the application of indirect taxes to our hosts , guests , and our platform significantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report , collect , and re ##mit taxes . even if we are able to build the required infrastructure and tools , we may not be able to complete them in a timely fashion , in particular given the speed at which regulations and their interpretations can change , which could harm our relationship with governments and our reputation , and result in enforcement actions and litigation . the lack of uniform ##ity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied to our platform and to our hosts and guests further increases the operational and financial complexity of our systems and processes , and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations , all of which are costly to our business and results of operations . certain regulations may be so complex as to make it in ##fe ##asi ##ble for us to be fully compliant . as our business operations expand or change , including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings , tier ##s or features , or due to acquisitions , the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our hosts and guests will further change and evolve , and could further increase our liability for taxes , discourage hosts and guests from using our platform , and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] we have a wholly - owned captive insurance subsidiary to manage the financial exposure related to our host and experiences protection insurance programs along with certain corporate insurance programs . our captive insurance subsidiary is a party to certain reins ##urance and ind ##em ##ni ##fication arrangements that transfer a portion of the risk from our insurance providers to the captive insurance subsidiary , which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves . as our business continues to develop and divers ##ify , we may choose to or have to transfer more risk to our captive insurance subsidiary as it may become more difficult to obtain insurance with current retention ##s or de ##du ##ct ##ible ##s and with similar terms to cover our exposure . our insurance reserves account includes unpaid losses , loss adjustment expenses for risks , and other associated expenses , such as defense costs retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary . these amounts are based on third - party act ##ua ##rial estimates , historical claim information , and industry data . while these reserves are believed to be adequate , our ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our results of operations and financial position .

[CLS] to improve efficiency , infrastructure , policies , and community support tools . the failure to develop the appropriate technology , infrastructure , policies , and community support tools , or to manage or properly train our community support team , could compromise our ability to resolve questions and complaints quickly and effectively . the number of our hosts and guests has grown significantly and such growth , as well as any future growth , will put additional pressure on our community support organization and our technology organization . in addition , as we service a global customer base and continue to grow outside of north america and europe , we need to be able to provide effective support that meets our hosts ’ and guests ’ needs and languages globally at scale . as part of our reduction in force announced in may 2020 , we significantly reduced the number of employees in our community support organization and our technology organization , which impacted our ability to provide effective support to our hosts and guests . our service is staffed based on complex algorithms that map to our business forecast ##s . any vol ##ati ##lity in those forecast ##s could lead to staff ##ing gaps that could impact the quality of our service . we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience back ##log incidents that lead to substantial delays or other issues in responding to requests for customer support , which may reduce our ability to effectively retain hosts and guests . [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of our community support is performed by a limited number of third - party service providers . we rely on our internal team and these third parties to provide timely and appropriate responses to the inquiries of hosts and guests that come to us via telephone , email , social media , and chat . reliance on these third parties requires that we provide proper guidance and training for their employees , maintain proper controls and procedures for interacting with our community , and ensure acceptable levels of quality and customer satisfaction are achieved . [SEP]
[CLS] we provide community support to hosts and guests and help to media ##te disputes between hosts and guests . we rely on information provided by hosts and guests and are at times limited in our ability to provide adequate support or help hosts and guests resolve disputes due to our lack of information or control . to the extent that hosts and guests are not satisfied with the quality or timeline ##ss of our community support or third - party support , we may not be able to retain hosts or guests , and our reputation as well as our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] when a host or guest has a poor experience on our platform , we may issue ref ##unds or coup ##ons for future stays . these ref ##unds and coup ##ons are generally treated as a reduction to revenue , and we may make pay ##outs for property damage claims under our host guarantee program , which we account for as consideration paid to a customer and is also generally treated as a reduction in revenue . a robust community support effort is costly , and we expect such cost to continue to rise in the future as we grow our business . we have historically seen a significant number of community support inquiries from hosts and guests . our efforts to reduce the number of community support requests may not be effective , and we could inc ##ur increased costs without corresponding revenue , which would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] a significant portion of our business is den ##omi ##nated and trans ##act ##ed in foreign cu ##rre ##ncies , which subjects us to foreign exchange risk . we offer integrated payments to our hosts and guests in over 40 cu ##rre ##ncies . generally speaking , u . s . dollar strength adverse ##ly impacts the translation of the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign cu ##rre ##ncies into the u . s . dollar . for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , approximately 50 % of our revenue was den ##omi ##nated in cu ##rre ##ncies other than u . s . dollars . [SEP]
[CLS] our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the u . s . dollar as a large portion of our costs are u . s . dollar - den ##omi ##nated . we also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of our assets , principally cash balance ##s held on behalf of hosts and guests , that are den ##omi ##nated in cu ##rre ##ncies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries , and our financial results are affected by the re ##me ##as ##ure ##ment and translation of these non - u . s . cu ##rre ##ncies into u . s . dollars , which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash , cash equivalent ##s , and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows . for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , the effects of exchange rates on our cash , cash equivalent ##s , and restricted cash totaled $ 134 . 1 million due to fluctuations in exchange rates and the weakening of the u . s . dollar . furthermore , our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by air ##bn ##b , which may not match the currency in which the host elects to get paid . in those cases , we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the host payment due to timing differences in such payments . for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , we recorded net foreign currency gains of $ 31 . 5 million in our consolidated statement of operations . while we have and may choose to enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure in the future , it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate exposure . strengthening of the u . s . dollar could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our results of operations and financial condition .

[CLS] we may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax lia ##bilities . [SEP]
[CLS] our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and inter ##com ##pan ##y arrangements , including the manner in which we operate our business , develop , value , manage , protect , and use our intellectual property , and determine the value of our inter ##com ##pan ##y transactions . the tax laws applicable to our business , including those of the united states and other jurisdictions , are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as air ##bn ##b . the taxi ##ng authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our method ##ologies for val ##uing developed technology or inter ##com ##pan ##y arrangements , which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our results of operations and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to regular review and audit by u . s . federal , state , local , and foreign tax authorities . for example , our 2008 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in the united states and california due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations , and our 2016 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in ireland . we are currently under examination for income taxes by the internal revenue service ( “ irs ” ) for the years 2013 , 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . we are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations . in december 2020 , we received a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013 . the notice proposes an increase to our u . s . taxa ##ble income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $ 1 . 35 billion , plus penalties and interest , which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $ 1 . 0 billion . we disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it . if we are not able to resolve the proposed adjustment at the irs examination - level , we plan to pursue all available administrative and , if necessary , judicial re ##med ##ies which may include : entering into administrative settlement discussions with the irs independent office of appeals ( “ irs appeals ” ) in 2021 , and if necessary petition ##ing the u . s . tax court ( “ tax court ” ) for red ##eter ##mina ##tion if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with irs appeals , and finally , and if necessary , appealing the tax court ’ s decision to the appropriate appellate court . if the irs pre ##va ##ils in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties , if any , exceeds our current reserves , such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations , and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow . [SEP]
[CLS] in the fourth quarter of 2020 , we completed a restructuring plan to rep ##at ##ria ##te our intellectual property to the united states to align with our evolving operations in a post co ##vid - 19 environment . the restructuring plan involved numerous inter ##com ##pan ##y arrangements and tax jurisdictions and required the valuation of multiple inter ##com ##pan ##y transactions which could be challenged by respective tax authorities , including as a result of reduced valuation ##s caused by forecast adjustments due to the impact of co ##vid - 19 , and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . we are currently under a multi ##lateral control ( “ ml ##c ” ) audit where a number of individual european state audit ##s are combined . the ml ##c audit is focused on va ##t characterization and compliance , access to host data , and transfer pricing . tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] the determination of our worldwide provision for ( benefit from ) income taxes and other tax lia ##bilities requires significant judgment by management , and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain . our provision for ( benefit from ) income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business , and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate . changes in accounting for inter ##com ##pan ##y transactions may also affect our effective tax rate . for example , with the adoption of as ##u no . 2016 - 16 , effective january 1 , 2018 , the income tax effects of an inter ##com ##pan ##y transfer are recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs , rather than amor ##tized over time , which may increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in a particular period . although we believe that our provision for ( benefit from ) income taxes is reasonable , the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could material ##ly affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made . in addition , our future tax expense could be adverse ##ly affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates , by changes in the valuation of our def ##erre ##d tax assets and lia ##bilities , or by changes in tax laws , regulations , or accounting principles . for example , we have previously incurred losses in the united states and certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future . we may also be subject to additional tax liability relating to indirect or other non - income taxes , as described in our risk factor titled “ — uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts , guests , or platform could increase our tax lia ##bilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform . ” our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change , and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may inc ##ur material additional tax lia ##bilities in the future , which would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our results of operations and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , in connection with any planned or future acquisitions , we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm ’ s - length or that are potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements . any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs , which could result in us inc ##ur ##ring additional tax lia ##bilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements , and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our results of operations and financial condition .

[SEP]
[CLS] consumer use of devices and platforms other than desktop computers creates challenges . if we are unable to operate effectively on these platforms , our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] people regularly access the internet through mobile phones , tablets , handheld computers , voice - assisted speakers , television set - top devices , smart television ##s , wear ##able ##s , and automobile in - dash systems . these devices enable new mod ##ali ##ties of interaction , such as conversation ##al user interfaces , and new inter ##media ##ries , such as “ super - apps ” like we ##cha ##t , where consumers can use many online services without leaving a particular app . we anti ##ci ##pate that the use of these means of access will continue to grow and that usage through desktop computers will continue to decline , especially in certain regions of the world experiencing the highest rate of internet adoption . the functionality and user experiences associated with these alternative devices , such as a smaller screen size or lack of a screen , may make the use of our platform through such devices more difficult than through a desktop computer , lower the use of our platform , and make it more difficult for our hosts to up ##load content to our platform . in addition , consumer purchasing patterns can differ on alternative devices , and it is uncertain how the proliferation of mobile devices will impact the use of our platform and services . mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar services meaning that such consumers may opt to use one of our competitors ’ services instead of ours . as a result , brand recognition and the consumer experience with our mobile app will likely become increasingly important to our business . in addition , these new mod ##ali ##ties create opportunities for device or systems companies , such as amazon , apple , and google , to control the interaction with our consumers and di ##sin ##ter ##media ##te existing platforms such as ours . [SEP]
[CLS] we need to provide solutions for consumers who are limited in the size of the app they can support on their mobile devices and address late ##ncy issues in countries with lower bandwidth for both desktop and mobile devices . because our platform contains data - intensive media , these issues are ex ##ace ##rba ##ted . as new devices , operating systems , and platforms continue to be released , it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our offerings and features to them , and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation , support , and maintenance of our offerings and features . [SEP]
[CLS] our success will also depend on the inter ##oper ##ability of our offerings with a range of third - party technologies , systems , networks , operating systems , and standards , including ios and android ; the availability of our mobile apps in app stores and in “ super - app ” environments ; and the creation , maintenance , and development of relationships with key participants in related industries , some of which may also be our competitors . in addition , if accessibility of various apps is limited by executive order or other government actions , the full functionality of devices may not be available to our customers . moreover , third - party platforms , services and offerings are constantly evolving , and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with those of third parties . if we lose such inter ##oper ##ability , we experience difficulties or increased costs in integrating our offerings into alternative devices or systems , or manufacturers or operating systems elect not to include our offerings , make changes that de ##grade the functionality of our offerings , or give prefer ##ential treatment to competitive products , the growth of our community and our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . this risk may be ex ##ace ##rba ##ted by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices . in the event consumers choose devices that do not already include or support our platform or do not install our mobile apps when they change or upgrade their devices , our traffic and host and guest engagement may be harmed . [SEP]
[CLS] if we are unable to adapt to changes in technology and the evolving demands of hosts and guests , our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology , evolving industry standards , consolidation , frequent new offering announcements , introductions , and enhancement ##s , and changing consumer demands and preferences . in 2018 , we began making inc ##rem ##ental investments in upgrading our technology platform to a service - oriented architecture , improving data management , and increasing our service reliability , and we invested heavily in our technology in 2019 . our future success will depend on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to continually inn ##ova ##te and improve the performance , features , and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive offerings and the evolving demands of hosts and guests . our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as token ##ization , crypt ##oc ##ur ##ren ##cies , new authentication technologies , such as bio ##metric ##s , distributed ledger and block ##chai ##n technologies , artificial intelligence , virtual and augmented reality , and cloud technologies . as a result , we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining , developing , and enhancing our technologies and platform ; however , these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful . for example , we may not make the appropriate investments in new technologies , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . further , technological innovation often results in un ##int ##ended consequences such as bugs , vu ##ln ##era ##bilities , and other [SEP]

[CLS] system failures . any such bug , vulnerability , or failure , especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change , could result in lost business , harm to our brand or reputation , consumer complaints , and other adverse consequences , any of which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] another critical component to our future success will be our ability to integrate new or emerging payment methods into our platform to offer alternative payment solutions to consumers . alternate payment providers such as ali ##pa ##y , pay ##tm , and we ##cha ##t pay operate closed - loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants . in many regions , particularly in asia where credit cards are not readily available and / or e - commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices , these and other emerging alternate payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers . [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to payment - related fraud and an increase in or failure to deal effectively with fraud , fraudulent activities , fictitious transactions , or illegal transactions would material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis . when hosts do not fulfill their obligations to guests , there are fictitious listings or fraudulent booking ##s on our platform , or there are host account takeover ##s , we have incurred and will continue to inc ##ur losses from claims by hosts and guests , and these losses may be substantial . such instances have and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such booking ##s , referred to as a “ charge ##back . ” for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , total charge ##back expense was $ 124 . 7 million . our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes , which have become increasingly common and sophisticated , could be adverse ##ly impacted by the adoption of new payment methods , the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms , including mobile and other devices , and our growth in certain regions , including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity . we expect that technically - knowledge ##able criminals will continue to attempt to ci ##rc ##um ##vent our anti - fraud systems . in addition , the payment card networks have rules around acceptable charge ##back ratios . if we are unable to effectively combat fictitious listings and fraudulent booking ##s on our platform , combat the use of fraudulent or stolen credit cards , or otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of charge - backs , we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks , any of which would material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our payments platform is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses , including money laundering , transactions in violation of economic and trade sanctions , corruption and bribery , terrorist financing , fraudulent listings , host account takeover ##s , or the fa ##ci ##lita ##tion of other illegal activity . use of our payments platform for illegal or improper uses has subjected us , and may subject us in the future , to claims , lawsuits , and government and regulatory investigations , inquiries , or requests , which could result in liability and reputation ##al harm for us . we have taken measures to detect and reduce fraud and illegal activities , but these measures need to be continually improved and may add friction to our booking process . these measures may also not be effective against fraud and illegal activities , particularly new and continually evolving forms of ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##ion . if these measures do not succeed in reducing fraud , our business , results of operations , and financial condition would be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] our payments platform is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight . our failure to comply with extensive , complex , overlapping , and frequently changing laws , rules , regulations , policies , legal interpretations , and regulatory guidance could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our payments platform is subject to various laws , rules , regulations , policies , legal interpretations , and regulatory guidance , including those governing : cross - border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers ; stored value and prep ##aid access ; foreign exchange ; privacy , data protection , and cyber ##se ##cu ##rity ; banking secrecy ; payment services ( including payment processing and settlement services ) ; consumer protection ; economic and trade sanctions ; anti - corruption and anti - bribery ; and anti - money laundering and counter - terrorist financing . as we expand and local ##ize our international activities , we have and will become increasingly subject to the laws of additional countries or geo ##graph ##ies . in addition , because we facilitate booking ##s on our platform worldwide , one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws . laws regulating our payments platform outside of the united states often impose different , more specific , or even conflicting obligations on us , as well as broader liability . for example , certain transactions that may be per ##missible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of the u . s . department of the treasury ’ s office of foreign assets control ( “ of ##ac ” ) or u . s . anti - money laundering or counter - terrorist financing regulations . [SEP]
[CLS] we have assessed , and will continue to assess , the ad ##e ##qua ##cy of our policies , procedures , and internal controls for ensuring compliance with applicable laws , rules , regulations , policies , legal interpretations , and regulatory guidance , including the ones described below . through these assessments , we have identified , and may in the future identify , certain gaps or weaknesses in our existing compliance programs , including in our policies , procedures , or internal controls . as a result of findings from these assessments , we have , are , and may in the future take certain actions , such as implementing enhancement ##s to our compliance measures and amend ##ing , up ##dating , or rev ##ising our policies , procedures , and internal controls , and other operational framework ##s , designed to monitor for and ensure compliance with existing and new laws , rules , regulations , policies , legal interpretations , and regulatory guidance . implementing appropriate measures to fully re ##media ##te or address findings from assessments of our compliance programs may require us to inc ##ur significant costs . [SEP]
[CLS] any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations , including the ones described in this risk factor , or orders of any governmental authority , including changes to or expansion of their interpretations , may subject us to significant fines , penalties , criminal and civil lawsuits , for ##feit ##ure of significant assets , enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions , result in additional compliance and li ##cens ##ure requirements , and increased regulatory scrutiny of our business . in addition , we may be forced to restrict or change our operations or business practices , make product changes , or delay planned product launches or improvements . any of the fore ##going could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our brand , reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition . the complexity of global regulatory and enforcement regimes , coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment , could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions , and have an adverse impact on , or result in the termination of , our relationships with financial institutions and other service providers on whom we rely for payment processing services . our ability to track and verify transactions to comply with [SEP]

[CLS] payments regulation [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , our wholly - owned subsidiary , air ##bn ##b payments , inc . ( “ air ##bn ##b payments ” ) , is registered as a “ money services business ” with the u . s . department of treasury ’ s financial crimes enforcement network ( “ fin ##cen ” ) , and subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement by fin ##cen under the bank secrecy act , as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 ( the “ bs ##a ” ) . air ##bn ##b payments has also obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter ( or its equivalent ) in various states and territories where such licenses are required . as a licensed money transmitter , air ##bn ##b payments is subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the handling and investment of customer funds , record keeping and reporting requirements , bonding requirements , and inspection by state regulatory agencies . in u . s . states and territories in which air ##bn ##b payments has not obtained a license to operate as a money transmitter ( or its equivalent ) , we may be required to apply for licenses or regulatory approval ##s , including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations . [SEP]
[CLS] we issue gift cards in the united states for use on our platform and are subject to consumer protection and disclosure regulations relating to those services . if we seek to expand our gift cards or other stored value card products and services , or as a result of regulatory changes , we may be subject to additional regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registration ##s , which we may not be able to obtain . [SEP]
[CLS] we principally provide our payment services to hosts and guests in the ee ##a through air ##bn ##b payments luxembourg sa ( “ ap ##lux ” ) , our wholly - owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a payments institution in luxembourg . ee ##a laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the ee ##a , which can make compliance more costly and operational ##ly difficult to manage . for example , countries that are ee ##a members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing european directive ##s , including the european union payment services directive , the revised payment services directive ( “ ps ##d ##2 ” ) , the e - money directive , and the fourth and fifth anti - money laundering directive ##s . further , we provide our payments services to hosts and guests in the united kingdom and other geo ##graph ##ies outside the united states and the ee ##a through air ##bn ##b payments uk limited ( “ ap ##uk ” ) , our wholly - owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as an electronic money institution ( “ emi ” ) in the united kingdom , as well as through our other wholly - owned payments entities . [SEP]
[CLS] ps ##d ##2 impose ##s new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a payment transaction . these authentication requirements were originally scheduled to commence in september 2019 , but european national supervisory authorities delayed enforcement until january 1 , 2021 , and they will go into force in the united kingdom on september 14 , 2021 . in many cases , strong customer authentication requires our european guests to engage in additional steps to authentic ##ate payment transactions and european hosts to perform authentication upon access to their pay ##out account or modification of their pay ##out account information . these additional authentication requirements may make our platform experience for hosts and guests in the european economic area substantially less convenient , and such loss of convenience could meaningful ##ly reduce the frequency with which our customers use our platform or could cause some hosts and guests to stop using our platform entirely , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in many countries or geo ##graph ##ies , it is and may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider , electronic money institution , financial institution , or otherwise . in such instances , we partner with local banks and licensed payment processors to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency . local regulators may slow or halt payments to hosts conducted through local banks and licensed payment processors or otherwise prohibit or imp ##ede us from doing business in a jurisdiction . we may be required to apply for various additional licenses , certification ##s , and regulatory approval ##s , including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations . there can be no assurance that we will be able to ( or decide to ) obtain any such licenses , certification ##s , and approval ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] there are substantial costs and potential changes to our offerings involved in obtaining , maintaining , and renew ##ing licenses , certification ##s , and approval ##s globally . our payments entities are subject to inspections , examinations , supervision , and regulation by each relevant regulating authority , including , within the united states , by each state in which air ##bn ##b payments is licensed . we could be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we are found to violate disclosure , reporting , anti - money laundering , economic and trade sanctions , capital ##ization , fund management , corporate governance and internal controls , risk management , privacy , data protection and data local ##ization , information security , banking secrecy , taxation , sanctions , or other laws and requirements , including those imposed on united kingdom emi ##s and luxembourg payments institutions . these factors could involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our offerings or services , require significant and costly operational changes , impose restrictions , limitations , or additional requirements on our business , or prevent us from providing our offerings or services in a given geography . [SEP]
[CLS] consumer protection [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the u . s . states and countries from which we provide payment services . in the united states , the dodd - frank act established the consumer financial protection bureau ( the “ cf ##p ##b ” ) , which is empowered to conduct rule ##making and supervision related to , and enforcement of , federal consumer financial protection laws . we are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations , as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations , including the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e as implemented by the cf ##p ##b . money transmitters such as air ##bn ##b payments are subject to direct supervision and periodic examination by the cf ##p ##b and are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services , follow specified error resolution procedures , and rei ##mb ##urse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer , [SEP]

[CLS] among other requirements . in addition , the cf ##p ##b may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services , including regulations defining unfair , dec ##eptive , or abusive acts or practices , and new model disclosure ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] we could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the dodd - frank act ’ s prohibition against unfair , dec ##eptive , or abusive acts or practices or other consumer financial protection laws enforced by the cf ##p ##b or other agencies . the cf ##p ##b ’ s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure . additionally , technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties , including plaintiffs ’ attorneys ’ fees . the dodd - frank act also em ##power ##s state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions . various government offices and agencies , including various state agencies and state attorneys general ( as well as the cf ##p ##b and the u . s . department of justice ) , have the authority to conduct reviews , investigations , and proceedings ( both formal and informal ) involving us or our subsidiaries . these examinations , inquiries and proceedings could result in , among other things , substantial fines , penalties or changes in business practices that may require us to inc ##ur substantial costs . [SEP]
[CLS] we provide payment services that may be subject to various u . s . state and federal privacy laws and regulations . relevant federal privacy laws include the g ##lb ##a , which ( along with its implementing regulations ) restrict ##s certain collection , processing , storage , use , and disclosure of personal information , requires notice to individuals of privacy practices , and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain non ##pu ##bl ##ic or otherwise legally protected information . these rules also impose requirements for the safeguard ##ing and proper destruction of personal information through the iss ##uance of data security standards or guidelines . see our risk factor titled “ — if we fail to comply with federal , state , and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection , we may face potentially significant liability , negative publicity , an erosion of trust , and increased regulation could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . ” [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to united kingdom and luxembourg payments - related consumer protection laws that are applicable to our business , regulators in european union member states could not ##ify ap ##uk and ap ##lux of local consumer protection laws that apply to our businesses , and could also seek to persuade the united kingdom and luxembourg regulators to order ap ##uk or ap ##lux to conduct their activities in the local country directly or through a branch office . these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of , or delay , our plans to expand our business in european union countries . [SEP]
[CLS] anti - money laundering and counter - terrorist financing [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to various anti - money laundering and counter - terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world , including the bs ##a . among other things , the bs ##a requires money services businesses ( including money transmitters such as air ##bn ##b payments ) to develop and implement risk - based anti - money laundering programs , report large cash transactions and suspicious activity , and maintain transaction records . the bs ##a prohibits , among other things , our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities . in connection with and when required by regulatory requirements , we make information available to certain u . s . federal and state , as well as certain foreign , government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering , terrorist financing , and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorization ##s . in certain circumstances , we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering , terrorist financing , or other illegal activities , and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers . regulators in the united states and globally may require us to further rev ##ise or expand our compliance program , including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions . in the european union , the implementation of the fourth anti - money laundering directive ( “ ml ##d ##4 ” ) may make compliance more costly and operational ##ly difficult to manage , lead to increased friction for customers , and result in a decrease in business . penalties for non - compliance with ml ##d ##4 could include fines of up to 10 % of ap ##uk ’ s or ap ##lux ’ s total annual turnover . in april 2018 , the european parliament adopted the european commission ’ s proposal for a fifth anti - money laundering directive ( “ ml ##d ##5 ” ) , containing more string ##ent provisions in certain areas , which will increase compliance costs . in july 2019 , the uk financial conduct authority ( “ fc ##a ” ) called on uk electronic money institutions to review their compliance with the requirements on safeguard ##ing of customer funds and to not ##ify the fc ##a in the event they identified any material non - compliance . ap ##uk notified the fc ##a that it had identified gaps in its compliance and was undertaking re ##media ##l action . the fc ##a , in turn , appointed a third - party skilled person to perform a review of ap ##uk ’ s safeguard ##ing systems and controls , in accordance with section 166 of the financial services and markets act 2000 ( as amended ) and all required actions identified by the skilled person were completed . the fc ##a closed the skilled persons review in august 2020 [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to governmental economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations that limit the scope of our offering . additionally , failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations could subject us to liability and negatively affect our business , results of operations and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by governments where we operate , including the u . s . government ( including without limitation regulations administered and enforced by of ##ac and the u . s . department of state ) , the council of the european union , the office of financial sanctions implementation of her majesty ’ s treasury in the united kingdom ( “ of ##si ” ) and the ministry of finance and commission de surveillance du sect ##eur fin ##an ##cier of luxembourg . these economic and trade sanctions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain specified countries , regions , their governments and , in certain circumstances , their nationals , and with individuals and entities that are specially - designated , such as individuals and entities included on of ##ac ’ s list of specially designated nationals ( “ sd ##n list ” ) , subject to eu / uk asset freeze ##s , or other sanctions measures . any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business , results of operations , and financial condition . our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise to comply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls . we maintain policies and procedures to implement these internal controls , which we periodically assess and update to the extent we identify compliance gaps . we routinely report to of ##ac on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to of ##ac sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations . we have also reported to of ##si on dealings with persons subject to eu / uk [SEP]

[CLS] sanctions . there is a risk that , despite the internal controls that we have in place , we have engaged in dealings with persons sanctioned under applicable sanctions laws . any non - compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations or related investigations could result in claims or actions against us and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . as our business continues to grow and regulations change , we may be required to make additional investments in our internal controls or modify our business . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in july 2019 , we conducted an internal review and have been holding related discussions with of ##ac regarding certain user activity on our platform that may have been inconsistent with our policies and the requirements of u . s . sanctions laws . the scope of this review included activity by users in certain countries and territories that were or are the target of u . s . sanctions laws . in july 2020 , of ##ac issued to us a caution ##ary letter and no administrative penalty with respect to certain aspects of that review concerning the crimea region of ukraine . the internal review also covered certain other issues concerning our compliance with of ##ac ’ s sanctions program , focusing in particular on our business in cuba , and as to our compliance with restrictions on transactions with specially designated nationals . we submitted the results of that internal review in final voluntary self disclosure ##s to of ##ac in september 2020 . in october 2020 , of ##ac issued to us caution ##ary letters and a no action letter , and no administrative penalties , with respect to the disclosed matters involving specially designated nationals . of ##ac ’ s review of our voluntary self disclosure regarding cuba is ongoing and we remain in close contact with of ##ac . depending upon of ##ac ’ s assessment of the cuba review , we could be subject to potentially significant monetary civil penalties and litigation , and our brand and reputation could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] we are subject to payment network rules and any material modification of our payment card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] the loss of our credit and de ##bit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or de ##bit cards . we are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules , including the payment card industry data security standards ( the “ pc ##i ds ##s ” ) . under the pc ##i ds ##s , we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use , storage , and transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud . if we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks , including the pc ##i ds ##s , we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks . such failure to comply may damage our relationship with payment card networks , subject us to restrictions , fines , penalties , damages , and civil liability , and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards , which would have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . moreover , the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or rein ##ter ##pre ##t existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with , or costly to implement . as a result , we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged . further , there is no guarantee that , even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks , we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges . we also cannot guarantee that our compliance with network rules or the pc ##i ds ##s will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft , loss , or mis ##use of the credit card data of customers or participants , or a security breach . we are also required to submit to periodic audit ##s , self - assessments , and other assessments of our compliance with the pc ##i ds ##s . if an audit , self - assessment , or other assessment indicates that we need to take steps to re ##media ##te any def ##iciencies , such re ##media ##tion efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time - consuming re ##media ##tion efforts , and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges . [SEP]
[CLS] we are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines prom ##ul ##gated by the national automated clearing house association ( “ na ##cha ” ) relating to payment transactions we process using the automated clearing house ( “ ac ##h ” ) network . like the payment networks , na ##cha may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time , which can require us to take more costly compliance measures or to develop more complex monitoring systems . [SEP]
[CLS] we rely on third - party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and payments made to hosts on our platform . if these third - party payment service providers become unavailable or we are subject to increased fees , our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] we rely on a number of third - party payment service providers , including payment card networks , banks , payment processors , and payment gateway ##s , to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to re ##mit payments to hosts on our platform . we have agreements with these providers , some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service . [SEP]
[CLS] if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all , our business may be disrupted , we would need to find an alternate payment service provider , and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment service provider in an acceptable time frame . if we are forced to migrate to other third - party payment service providers for any reason , the transition would require significant time and management resources , and may not be as effective , efficient , or well - received by our hosts and guests . any of the fore ##going could cause us to inc ##ur significant losses and , in certain cases , require us to make payments to hosts out of our funds , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the software and services provided by our third - party payment service providers may fail to meet our expectations , contain errors or vu ##ln ##era ##bilities , be compromised , or experience out ##ages . any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to hosts on our platform , which could make our platform less convenient and desirable to customers and adverse ##ly affect our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests .

[CLS] moreover , our agreements with payment service providers may allow these companies , under certain conditions , to hold an amount of our cash as a reserve . they may be entitled to a reserve or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events , including material adverse changes in our business , results of operations , and financial condition . an imp ##osition of a reserve or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies , could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] if we fail to invest adequate resources into the payment processing infrastructure on our platform , or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable , our payments activities may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings , which could adverse ##ly impact their usage . further , our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon the third - party providers we use to support these activities . as we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geo ##graph ##ies or offer new payment methods to our hosts and guests in the future , we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements , and exposed to heightened fraud risk , which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses . [SEP]
[CLS] for certain payment methods , including credit and de ##bit cards , we pay interchange and other fees , and such fees result in significant costs . payment card network costs have increased , and may continue to increase in the future , the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that access ##es their networks , and may impose special fees or assessments on any such transaction . our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us . credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through de ##bit cards . any material increase in interchange fees in the united states or other geo ##graph ##ies , including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geo ##graph ##ies , or other network fees or assessments , or a shift from payment with de ##bit cards to credit cards could increase our operating costs and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] we experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue , which occurs upon check - in . the effect of significant down ##turn ##s in booking ##s in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods because of this timing in revenue recognition . in response to the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , we are making certain payments to hosts and issuing guest cancellation coup ##ons to guests , which we account for as consideration paid to a customer and result in a reduction to revenue .

[CLS] if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and our data , our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected . [SEP]
[CLS] we hold a broad collection of intellectual property rights related to our brand ; certain content and design elements on our platform ; inventions related to our platform , services , and research and development efforts ; an extensive repository of wholly - owned audio and visual assets ; marketing and promotional concepts and materials ; a collection of editorial content ; and certain entertainment - related assets . this includes registered domain names , registered and un ##re ##gist ##ered trademark ##s , service marks , and copyright ##s , patents and patent applications , trade secrets , licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds , and other forms of intellectual property rights in the united states and in a number of countries around the world . in addition , to further protect our proprietary rights , from time to time we have purchased patents , trademark ##s , domain name registration ##s , and copyright ##s from third parties . in the future we may acquire or license additional patents or patent portfolio ##s , or other intellectual property assets and rights from third parties , which could require significant cash expenditures . [SEP]
[CLS] we rely on a combination of trademark , patent , copyright , and trade secret laws , international treaties , our terms of service , other contractual provisions , user policies , restrictions on disclosure , technological measures , and confidential ##ity and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property assets from infringement and mis ##app ##ropriation . our pending and future trademark , patent , and copyright applications may not be approved . furthermore , effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business . there can be no assurance that others will not offer technologies , products , services , features , or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business , or copy or otherwise obtain , disclose and / or use our brand , content , design elements , creative , editorial , and entertainment assets , or other proprietary information without authorization . we may be unable to prevent third parties from seeking to register , acquire , or otherwise obtain trademark ##s , service marks , domain names , or social media handles that are similar to , in ##fr ##inge upon or dim ##ini ##sh the value of our trademark ##s , service marks , copyright ##s , and our other proprietary rights . third parties have also obtained or mis ##app ##rop ##riated certain of our data through website scraping , robots , or other means to launch copy ##cat sites , aggregate our data for their internal use , or to feature or provide our data through their respective websites , and / or launch businesses mon ##eti ##zing this data . while we routinely employ technological and legal measures in an attempt to divert , halt , or mit ##igate such operations , we may not always be able to detect or halt the underlying activities as technologies used to accomplish these operations continue to rapidly evolve . [SEP]
[CLS] our intellectual property assets and rights are essential to our business . if the protection of our proprietary rights and data is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or mis ##app ##ropriation by third parties , the value of our brand and other int ##ang ##ible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our technologies , offerings , or features or methods of operations . even if we do detect violations or mis ##app ##ropriation ##s and decide to enforce our rights , litigation may be necessary to enforce our rights , and any enforcement efforts we undertake could be time - consuming and expensive , could divert our management ’ s attention , and may result in a court determining that certain of our intellectual property rights are une ##n ##force ##able . if we fail to protect our intellectual property and data in a cost - effective and meaningful manner , our competitive standing could be harmed ; our hosts , guests , other consumers , and corporate and [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] the internet and technology industries are characterized by significant creation and protection of intellectual property rights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement , mis ##app ##ropriation , or other violations of such intellectual property rights . there may be intellectual property rights held by others , including issued or pending patents , trademark ##s , and copyright ##s , and applications of the fore ##going , that they all ##ege cover significant aspects of our platform , technologies , content , branding , or business methods . moreover , companies in the internet and technology industries are frequent targets of practicing and non - practicing entities seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses . like many other companies in the internet and technology industries , we sometimes enter into agreements which include ind ##em ##ni ##fication provisions related to intellectual property which can subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an ind ##em ##nified third party . [SEP]
[CLS] we have received in the past , and may receive in the future , communications from third parties , including practicing and non - practicing entities , claiming that we have in ##fr ##inge ##d , mis ##used , or otherwise mis ##app ##rop ##riated their intellectual property rights , including alleged patent infringement . additionally , we have been , and may in the future be , involved in claims , suits , regulatory proceedings , and other proceedings involving alleged infringement , mis ##use , or mis ##app ##ropriation of third - party intellectual property rights , or relating to our intellectual property holdings and rights . while a number of the infringement claims raised against us have been based on our use or implementation of third - party technologies for which those third parties have been required to defend against the claims on our behalf and ind ##em ##ni ##fy us from liability , intellectual property claims against us , regardless of merit , could be time consuming and expensive to lit ##igate or settle and could divert our management ’ s attention and other resources . see part 1 , item 3 . legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10 - k and note 13 , [SEP]

[CLS] claims involving intellectual property could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using certain technologies , content , branding , or business methods found to be in violation of another party ’ s rights . we might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others , which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms , or at all . even if a license is available , we could be required to pay significant royalties , which would increase our operating expenses . we may also be required to develop alternative non - in ##fr ##inging technology , content , branding , or business methods , which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive . any of these results could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our ability to compete and our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we may introduce new offerings or changes to existing offerings or make other business changes , including in areas where we currently do not compete , which could increase our exposure to patent , copyright , trademark , and other intellectual property rights claims from competitors , other practicing entities , and non - practicing entities . similarly , our exposure to risks associated with various intellectual property claims may increase as a result of acquisitions of other companies . third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired a company or technology that had not been asserted prior to the acquisition . [SEP]
[CLS] our use of “ open source ” software could adverse ##ly affect our ability to offer our platform and services and subject us to costly litigation and other disputes . [SEP]
[CLS] we have in the past incorporated and may in the future incorporate certain “ open source ” software into our code base as we continue to develop our platform and services . open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses , which in some instances may subject us to certain un ##fa ##vor ##able conditions , including requirements that we offer our products that incorporate the open source software for no cost , that we make publicly available the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based upon , incorporating or using the open source software , or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license . in addition to using open source software , we also license to others some of our software through open source projects . open sour ##cing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available , and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software . from time to time , companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of open source software or compliance with open source license terms . furthermore , there is an increasing number of open - source software license types , almost none of which have been tested in a court of law , resulting in a dear ##th of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses . we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non ##com ##pl ##iance with open source licensing terms . [SEP]
[CLS] while we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third - party open source software and protect our proprietary source code , ina ##d ##vert ##ent use of open source software is fairly common in software development in the internet and technology industries . such ina ##d ##vert ##ent use of open source software could expose us to claims of non - compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses , which could lead to un ##for ##ese ##en business disruption ##s , including being restricted from offering parts of our product which incorporate the software , being required to publicly release proprietary source code , being required to re - engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms , or being required to extract the open source software at issue . our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our core source code base , introducing new offerings , integrating acquired - company technologies , or making other business changes , including in areas where we do not currently compete . any of the fore ##going could adverse ##ly impact the value or enforce ##ability of our intellectual property , and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition .

[CLS] we believe that focusing on the long - term best interests of our company and our consideration of all of our stakeholders , including our shareholders , hosts , guests , employees , the communities in which we operate , and other stakeholders we may identify from time to time , is essential to the long - term success of our company and to long - term shareholder value . therefore , we have made decisions , and may in the future make decisions , that we believe are in the long - term best interests of our company and our shareholders , even if such decisions may negatively impact the short - or medium - term performance of our business , results of operations , and financial condition or the short - or medium - term performance of our class a common stock . our commitment to pursuing long - term value for the company and its shareholders , potentially at the expense of short - or medium - term performance , may material ##ly adverse ##ly affect the trading price of our class a common stock , including by making owning our class a common stock less appealing to investors who are focused on returns over a shorter time horizon . our decisions and actions in pursuit of long - term success and long - term shareholder value , which may include changes to our platform to enhance the experience of our hosts , guests , and the communities in which we operate , including by improving the trust and safety of our platform , changes in the manner in which we deliver community support , investing in our relationships with our hosts , guests , and employees , investing in and introducing new products and services , or changes in our approach to working with local or national jurisdictions on laws and regulations governing our business , may not result in the long - term benefits that we expect , in which case our business , results of operations , and financial condition , as well as the trading price of our class a common stock , could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected .

[SEP]
[CLS] our class a common stock has one vote per share , our class b common stock has 20 votes per share , our class c common stock has no votes per share , and our class h common stock has no votes per share . as of december 31 , 2020 , the holders of our outstanding class b common stock beneficial ##ly owned 79 . 5 % of our outstanding capital stock and held 98 . 8 % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock , with our directors , executive officers , and holders of more than 5 % of our common stock , and their respective affiliates , beneficial ##ly owning 48 . 5 % of our outstanding capital stock and holding 59 . 6 % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock . because of the 20 - to - one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock , the holders of our class b common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stock ##holders for approval until all such outstanding shares of class b common stock have converted into shares of our class a common stock . furthermore , our founders , who collectively held 42 . 8 % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of december 31 , 2020 , are party to a voting agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors . we and each of our founders are party to a no ##minating agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors , include them in our proxy statement , and sol ##ici ##t pro ##xie ##s or consent ##s in favor of elect ##ing each founder to our board of directors . this concentrated control will limit or pre ##cl ##ude your ability to influence corporate matters for the fore ##see ##able future , including the election of directors , amendments of our organizational documents , and any merger , consolidation , sale of all or substantially all of our assets , or other major corporate transaction requiring stock ##holder approval . in addition , this may prevent or discourage un ##sol ##ici ##ted acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stock ##holders may believe are in their best interest . [SEP]
[CLS] future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock , subject to limited exceptions , such as certain transfers effect ##ed for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders , if all of our founders agree to such transfers . each share of our class b common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the class b holder into one share of class a common stock . the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect , over time , of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term . as a result , it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our class b common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of class b common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into class a common stock . in addition , the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock would dil ##ute holders of class a common stock in terms of voting power within the class a common stock . in addition , any future iss ##uance ##s of common stock would be dil ##utive to holders of class a common stock . for example , because our class c common stock carries no voting rights ( except as otherwise required by law ) , if we issue class c common stock in the future , the holders of class b common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stock ##holders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued class a common stock rather than class c common stock in such transactions . further , each outstanding share of class h common stock will convert into a share of class a common stock on a share - for - share basis upon the sale of such share of class h common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary , which would dil ##ute holders of class a common stock in terms of voting power within the class a common stock .

[CLS] we cannot predict the effect our multi - series structure may have on the market price of our class a common stock . [SEP]
[CLS] we cannot predict whether our multi - series structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our class a common stock , in adverse publicity , or other adverse consequences . for example , certain index providers , such as s & p dow jones , have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple - class share structures in certain of their indices , including the s & p 500 . accordingly , the multi - series structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and , as a result , mutual funds , exchange - traded funds , and other investment vehicles that attempt to passive ##ly track those indices may not invest in our class a common stock . these policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect , if any , they will have on the valuation ##s of publicly - traded companies excluded from such indices , but it is possible that they may de ##press valuation ##s , as compared to similar companies that are included . because of the multi - class structure of our common stock , we will likely be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure that other stock indices will not take similar actions . given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices , exclusion from certain stock indices would likely pre ##cl ##ude investment by many of these funds and could make our class a common stock less attractive to other investors . as a result , the market price of our class a common stock could be adverse ##ly affected .

[CLS] future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall . [SEP]
[CLS] sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market , or the perception that these sales might occur in large quantities , could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline and could imp ##air our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had 115 , 49 ##9 , 875 shares of class a common stock outstanding , 48 ##3 , 69 ##7 , 162 shares of class b common stock outstanding , no shares of class c common stock outstanding , and 9 , 200 , 000 shares of class h common stock outstanding .

[CLS] under our rest ##ated certificate of incorporation , we are authorized to issue 2 , 000 , 000 , 000 shares of class c common stock . any future iss ##uance of class c common stock may have the effect of further concentrating voting control in our class b common stock , including the class b common stock held by our founders , [SEP]

[CLS] if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish un ##fa ##vor ##able research about our business , our stock price and trading volume could decline . [SEP]
[CLS] the trading market for our class a common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business . if one or more of these analysts cease ##s coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly , we could lose visibility in the financial markets , which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline . moreover , if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community , one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change their recommendations regarding our company , and our stock price could decline . [SEP]
[CLS] future sales and iss ##uance ##s of our class a common stock or rights to purchase our class a common stock , including pursuant to our equity incentive plans , or other equity securities or securities convertible into our class a common stock , could result in additional dil ##ution of the percentage ownership of our stock ##holders and could cause the stock price of our class a common stock to decline .

[CLS] in the future , we may sell class a common stock , other series of common stock , convertible securities , or other equity securities , including preferred securities , in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time . we also expect to issue class a common stock to employees , consultants , and directors pursuant to our equity incentive plans . if we sell class a common stock , other series of common stock , convertible securities , or other equity securities in subsequent transactions , or class a common stock or class b common stock is issued pursuant to equity incentive plans , investors may be material ##ly dil ##uted . new investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights , preferences , and privileges senior to those of holders of our class a common stock .

[SEP]
[CLS] any provision of our certificate of incorporation , by ##law ##s or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deter ##ring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stock ##holders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock , and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock .

[CLS] against the company or any of our current or former director , officer , employee , agent or stock ##holder arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our certificate of incorporation or by ##law ##s or as to which the delaware general corporation law con ##fers jurisdiction on the court of chance ##ry of the state of delaware , or ( d ) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine ; ( ii ) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum , the federal district courts of the united states will , to the full ##est extent permitted by law , be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act of 1933 , as amended ( the “ securities act ” ) , and the rules and regulations prom ##ul ##gated there ##under ; ( iii ) any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the company will be deemed to have notice of and consent ##ed to these provisions ; and ( iv ) failure to enforce the fore ##going provisions would cause us ir ##re ##para ##ble harm , and we will be entitled to e ##quitable relief , including in ##jun ##ctive relief and specific performance , to enforce the fore ##going provisions . nothing in our rest ##ated certificate of incorporation or amended and rest ##ated by ##law ##s pre ##cl ##udes stock ##holders that assert claims under the securities exchange act of 1934 , as amended ( the “ exchange act ” ) , from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the exchange act con ##fers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims , subject to applicable law . [SEP]
[CLS] we believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellor ##s and judges , as applicable , particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes , efficient administration of cases on a more ex ##ped ##ited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burden ##s of multi - forum litigation . if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our rest ##ated certificate of incorporation or amended and rest ##ated by ##law ##s to be ina ##pp ##lica ##ble or une ##n ##force ##able in an action , we may inc ##ur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . for example , section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations there ##under . accordingly , there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the securities act . [SEP]
[CLS] the choice of forum provisions may limit a stock ##holder ’ s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former director , officer , other employee , agent , or stock ##holder to the company , which may discourage such claims against us or any of our current or former director , officer , other employee , agent , or stock ##holder to the company and result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim . [SEP]
[CLS] general risk factors [SEP]
[CLS] the value of our market ##able securities could decline , which could adverse ##ly affect our results of operations and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] our market ##able securities portfolio includes various holdings , types , and mat ##urities . market values of these investments can be adverse ##ly impacted by various factors , including liquid ##ity in the underlying security , credit deterioration , the financial condition of the credit issue ##r , foreign exchange rates , and changes in interest rates . our market ##able securities , which we consider highly - liquid investments , are classified as available - for - sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value . un ##real ##ized gains and losses on available - for - sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) in stock ##holders ’ equity ( deficit ) . realized gains and losses and other than - temporary impairment ##s are reported within other income ( expense ) , net in the consolidated statements of operations . our market ##able equity securities with readily deter ##mina ##ble fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income ( expense ) , net in the consolidated statements of operations . [SEP]
[CLS] if the fair value of our market ##able equity securities declines , our earnings will be reduced or losses will be increased . furthermore , our interest income from cash , cash equivalent ##s , and our market ##able securities are impacted by changes in interest rates , and a decline in interest rates would adverse ##ly impact our interest income . [SEP]
[CLS] we will inc ##ur significant expenses as a result of being a public company , which could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] as a public company , we will inc ##ur significant legal , accounting , and other expenses that we did not inc ##ur as a private company . we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act , the applicable requirements of the sar ##bane ##s - ox ##ley act , the dodd - frank act , the rules and regulations of the sec , and the listing rules of the nas ##da ##q stock market llc ( “ nas ##da ##q ” ) . stock ##holder activism and the level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations , which may lead to additional significant compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anti ##ci ##pate . the increased costs will increase our net loss or decrease our net income , and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase our service fees which could result in a reduction in booking ##s . for example , we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance . the impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors , on our board committees , or as executive officers . furthermore , if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company , we could be subject to del ##ist ##ing of our class a common stock , fines , sanctions , and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation . [SEP]
[CLS] further , the majority of our management team , including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer , have either no or limited experience in managing publicly - traded companies . our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors . these new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day - to - day management of our business , and could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] as a public reporting company , we are subject to rules and regulations established by the sec and nas ##da ##q regarding our internal control over financial reporting . we may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner , [SEP]

[CLS] or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective , which may adverse ##ly affect investor confidence in our company and , as a result , the value of our class a common stock and your investment . [SEP]
[CLS] as a public reporting company , we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the sec and nas ##da ##q . these rules and regulations will require , among other things , that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting . reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems , processes and controls , as well as on our personnel , including senior management . in addition , as a public company , we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sar ##bane ##s - ox ##ley act so that our management can ce ##rti ##fy as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting . management ’ s initial certification under section 404 of the sar ##bane ##s - ox ##ley act will be required with our annual report on form 10 - k for the year ending december 31 , 2021 . in support of such certification ##s , we will be required to document and make significant changes and enhancement ##s , including potentially hiring additional personnel , to our internal control over financial reporting . likewise , our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an at ##test ##ation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 , 2021 . as a result , we anti ##ci ##pate investing significant resources to enhance and maintain our financial and managerial controls , reporting systems , and procedures . [SEP]
[CLS] to date , neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sar ##bane ##s - ox ##ley act because no such evaluation has been required . if our management is unable to ce ##rti ##fy the effectiveness of our internal controls , our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an un ##qual ##ified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting , we identify or fail to re ##media ##te material weaknesses in our internal controls , or we do not effectively or accurately report our financial performance to the appropriate regulators on a timely basis , we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investor confidence , which could significantly harm our reputation and our stock price , and material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with a revision to previously issued financial statements for the year ended december 31 , 2017 relating to the provision for income taxes resulting from the incorrect use of tax attributes . we identified that the cause of the income tax provision adjustment was a lack of qualified tax personnel with an appropriate level of experience to review the use of tax attributes in accordance with tax ordering rules . while we re ##media ##ted this material weakness as of december 31 , 2018 through hiring additional experienced personnel , we can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future . a material weakness is a deficiency , or combination of def ##iciencies , in internal control over financial reporting , such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material miss ##tate ##ment of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis . we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date , and actions we may take in the future , will be sufficient to prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses . a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased probability of fraud , the potential loss of customers , litigation from our stock ##holders , reduction in our ability to obtain financing , and require additional expenditures to re ##media ##te . our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and complete ##ness of our financial reports and a decline in our stock price , and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] the failure to successfully implement and maintain accounting systems could material ##ly adverse ##ly impact our business , results of operations , and financial condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in the third quarter of 2019 , we implemented a new third - party revenue accounting system in order to auto ##mate our revenue accounting and reporting processes . system implementations of this scale are complex and time - consuming projects that require transformations of business and financial processes . such transformations involve risk inherent in the conversion to a new system , including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations . additionally , if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business , the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adverse ##ly affected . any failure to develop , implement , or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could material ##ly adverse ##ly affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations . in addition , if we experience interruption ##s in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems , our business , results of operations , and financial condition could be material ##ly adverse ##ly affected .

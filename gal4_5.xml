		<segment id="2" parent="24" relname="span">So you're right,</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="24" relname="circumstance">the incremental $80 million of inflation</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">that we've now baked into the outlook.</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="6" relname="preparation">Basically, we've been offsetting</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="25" relname="span">that through 3 things or plan to offset that through 3 things.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="8" relname="solutionhood">There's some selective incremental pricing that we plan to put in the market this year that will cover a portion of it.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="26" relname="span">We also think that we have an opportunity to optimize particularly promotional spend,</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="26" relname="motivation">which is another big lever that we're seeing an opportunity to partially offset.</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="27" relname="span">And then the third piece is we are doubling down on opportunity to drive more overhead cost savings.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="10" relname="evaluation">And so those 3 elements we see upside in that basically we're using to offset the incremental inflation,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="circumstance">which is allowing us to sort of hold the outlook for the year.</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="12" relname="condition">And that's what's baked into the plan.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="15" relname="justify">On the buyback question,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="16" relname="elaboration">we authorized, as part of the CH&amp;S divestiture,</segment>
		<segment id="16" >$375 million.</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="18" relname="condition">We -- as I mentioned, we bought back $275 million in Q1.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="19" relname="elaboration">We did execute a 10b-5 program that executed in the month of April,</segment>
		<segment id="19" >and we bought back $50 million additional in the month of April.</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="19" relname="result">And so we've got $50 million remaining that we will look to do prior to the end of the year.</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="22" relname="circumstance">As you know, our cash flow is stronger towards the end of the calendar year based on the seasonality of our business.</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="23" relname="preparation">So we do expect to generate good cash flow. We do expect to complete the incremental share repurchase program this year.</segment>
		<segment id="23" >And then we'll look to incremental opportunities as we get closer to the end of the year.</segment>
